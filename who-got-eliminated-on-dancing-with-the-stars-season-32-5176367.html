The brand-new season kicked off on September 26 with <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>14 couples</a>. So far, each episode has ended with an elimination. This season, the show returned to using each pair’s weekly scores and America’s votes to determine who will be sent home. There is no judges’ save in season 32.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>Each week, one celebrity and their pro partner will be eliminated. This all leads up to the epic finale event where one pair will be crowned the new DWTS champion and win the Len Goodman Mirrorball Trophy. So, who’s been voted off Dancing with the Stars season 32? Scroll down to learn who has gotten eliminated so far this season.</p><h2>Harry Jowsey and Rylee Arnold</h2><p id=content-paragraph-4><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Harry Jowsey</strong></a> and <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Rylee Arnold</strong></a> made a splash from the moment they hit the dance floor. They captured the hearts of viewers with their adorable partnership (and <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>even some romance rumors</a>). Despite not being the most skilled dancer of the bunch, Harry always had a positive attitude about dancing. Rylee dazzled in her first-ever season as a pro.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/harry-eliminated-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-5>During Taylor Swift Night, Harry and Rylee danced a rumba to “August.” They earned a 30 out of 40 from the judges. They later lost a relay dance to <strong>Alyson Hannigan</strong> and<strong> Sasha Farber</strong>. At the end of the night, Harry and Rylee were <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>shockingly sent home</a>.</p><h2>Barry Williams and Peta Murgatroyd</h2><p id=content-paragraph-6><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Barry Williams</strong> </a>and <strong>Peta Murgatroyd</strong> danced a sensual rumba to “Didn’t We Almost Have It All” during Whitney Houston Night on November 14.

Once the votes were in, Barry and Peta were sent home. After the results, the crowd chanted Barry’s name.

The couple had kicked off the November 7 episode with a sexy salsa to <strong>Shakira’s</strong> “Wherever, Whenever.” Lele and Brandon earned a 33 out of 40 from the judges.

The DWTS pair was eliminated just days after they were spotted <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>holding hands</a>. Mauricio and Emma fervently <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>denied any dating rumors</a>.</p><p id=content-paragraph-11>For Monster Night, Mauricio and Emma brought the intensity with their Argentine tango and earned a 31 out of 40. <strong>Carrie Ann Inaba</strong> pointed out that Mauricio had “come so far” since his first week.
