They wanted to know if one of them had actually died or was it just a sick joke from them. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Some also speculated that it might be related to their break up. The twins have now clarified all confusion in a recent Instagram upload.</p><h2>Alisov Brothers and Their Death Rumors</h2><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>The twins set off the speculations that one of them might be dead through a cryptic post on December 17, 2021, on their TikTok @alisovbrothers.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>In the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">post&nbsp;captioned</a> "#rip miss you," one of the twins was seen sitting with a black top on. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>He looked upset. In an inset right above his head, a video played which showed the twins' times together in the past.</p><p>The inset's placement implied that he was remembering the good memories with his apparently dead brother.</p><p>The sad music playing in the background added to the upsetting effect of the video. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Shortly after this, another video appeared on the channel. This was a post further "confirming" that one of them had died.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>The <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">second video</a> showed the same twin with the same top. But this time, he was close to the camera, and tears could be seen running down his cheeks.</p><p>The clip begins as his eyes are closed. Then, a translucent hand, implying the hand of the dead brother trying to reach out, appeared&nbsp;on his right shoulder. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>The one in the video opened&nbsp;his eyes as soon as he "felt" the ghostly touch.</p><p>"i cannot believe it...," the caption began&nbsp;and ended with "(more on inst: alisovbrothers)" as the whole ordeal played out with a song titled 'I Wanna Ruin Our Friendship.'</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>These two posts strongly suggested that one of them had died&nbsp;and the other was mourning and experiencing supernatural phenomena.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>People in the comment sections, though, were having none of it.</p><h2>Alisov Brothers Faked Their Death</h2><p>With massive traction comes massive scrutiny. And that's what happened with these two videos.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>People, who were already skeptical about <a href=# rel="follow noopener">their relationship</a>, took to the comment section of the videos to voice their concerns and discontentment. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-618 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Most of these were from people who did not believe any of them was dead. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>The comments that appeared on the first video did&nbsp;not even seem to acknowledge the alleged death. They just talked about how their mother must have found out about their relationship and break up.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p>"they must've got caught," said one <a href=# rel=follow>TikTok user</a> while another chimed in with, "guys calm down he just broke up with his TWIN" with a clear emphasis on them being twins.</p><p>Further below, some were asking if it was just a skit.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>"It better be a very sick joke..," said a third.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>There were also some actually worried people. They were seeking answers about whether they were okay.</p><p>Moving on to the reactions in the other video, it was more or less similar comments. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-175 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>Someone named 'Random Username' was asking which one of them had died rather than if one of them had died. Presumably a twin joke.</p><p>A few others opined that this was just a PR tactic as they had more followers on TikTok than they had on Instagram and they wanted to transfer the viewership over to the next one.</p><p>Everyone&nbsp;claiming this was just a skit was right. The twins clarified what had happened on their Instagram stories on January 20. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-176 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>One of the twins who had presumably written the post&nbsp;shared that they had gotten into a fight a few days ago.</p><p>Due to this, one of them moved out. He also did not return&nbsp;calls.</p><p></p><p><strong>Alisov Brothers clarified their death rumors and the reason for the posts about one of them being dead.</strong> (Photo: Alisov Brothers/Instagram)</p><p>So&nbsp;the one who was at home made these TikToks as a way to get a response from the other.</p><p>It apparently worked, and he announced they were back filming again.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Their first post after getting <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">back together</a> came on TikTok on January 20. In the video, one of them lip-synced a dialogue from BoJack Horseman.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_5"></span><p>"I don't like being around you because I feel bad," one said&nbsp;as he pulled the other one close.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>It remains to be seen if they address their break up anytime soon.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_6"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaJmcnsCwwoybqaismJq%2FtHnDnpitoF6dwa64</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2falisov-brothers-death-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2falisov-brothers-death-html.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2falisov-brothers-death-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2falisov-brothers-death-html.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2falisov-brothers-death-html.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2falisov-brothers-death-html.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./angie-everhart.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./angie-everhart.html>Angie Everhart Biography</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./zira-browns-boyfriend-list.html>Zira Browns Boyfriend: Who is Zira Brown Dating?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./zira-browns-boyfriend-list.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
