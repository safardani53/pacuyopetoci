The actress is at the top of her game right now with the release of Purple Hearts, a Netflix movie she appears in&nbsp;opposite <a href=# rel=follow>Nicholas Galitzine</a>. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-8 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>She has always taken her acting and singing careers together, for both of which she got inspiration from her childhood idols. And while she definitely had celebrity idols, she also had people to look up to in her immediate family — her parents.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>The Latino star gives a lot of credit to her parents, who taught her about both American and her native Colombian cultures and languages, and also always supported her in whatever she pursued in life. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>Sofia Carson's Parents, Ethnicity, and Bicultural Raisings</h2><p>Carson, whose real name is Sofia Daccarett Char, was born on April 10, 1993, in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, to Colombian immigrants. Her father, Jose F. Daccarett, and her mother, Laura Char Carson, are from Barranquilla, Colombia.</p><p>She is related to the Char family of Colombian politics through her mom. However, her maternal grandmother, Lauraine Carson, is American, and inspired her stage name, Sofia Carson.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Despite being born in Florida, her parents taught her and her sister, Paulina Char, both American and Latin culture. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p></p><p><strong>Sofia Carson with her father, Jose F. Daccarett, and sister, Paulina Char.</strong> (Photo:&nbsp;Jose F. Daccarett/<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Instagram</a>)</p><p>"My mom is Colombian, so I was raised going to Colombia every year to see my family," she told <a href=# rel="follow noopener">Mom</a> magazine during an interview in July 2015. When asked about her bilinguality, she said she was "lucky" to be able to speak both English and Spanish. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>"We were raised eating mac and cheese and popcorn, but also, deditos de queso, empanadas, arroz con pollo," she added. And she was raised both on reggaeton and pop, with Michael Jackson and&nbsp;Stevie Wonder being the most played American artists at home.</p><p>However, despite knowing it was good to have known both cultures so well, she did not understand how important her parents' teachings were until she started achieving success in the industry.</p><p>She had that revelation when she landed the role of Evie in The Descendants in 2015. Her character was to have a journey to a place that was like another world — an experience similar to what her parents went through when they arrived in the US. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Her understanding of that scenario helped her relate to and portray Evie better. And it also helped her communicate with her fans around the world, some of who might not necessarily understand English but understand Spanish.</p><p>Carson was always into performing. "I've&nbsp;known since I was 3, twirling around the living room in my Belle gown from&nbsp;Beauty and the Beast," she said of her interest in acting and singing in an interview with <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Miami Herald</a> in July 2015. "I couldn't picture myself doing anything else."</p><p>At 18, she moved across the country to study at UCLA. Her parents would let her do however many acting auditions she wanted as long as she was also studying.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>Now, she is adding the tags of a producer and a soundtrack writer to her actress/singer-songwriter resume. And she is the first-ever global ambassador for the Latin Grammy Cultural Foundation.</p><h2>Sofia Carson's Mom's Influence</h2><p>Purple Hearts was the most difficult job Carson has ever undertaken. She would not have made it out the other side if it was not for her mother's support.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Laura was the one to first inspire Carson to be a multi-hyphenate. She introduced her daughter to Jennifer Lopez, Barbra Streisand, and Cher, all of whom were more than just one-trick ponies.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_5"></span><p>And while Carson looked up to those famous women, she looked up to her mother more. "We worked together on my career. I call her my head of management. She is my partner. She is my everything," she said of Laura during her <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">interview with Netflix</a>. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>Carson also realized the importance of speaking up for herself from her mother. She noticed how Laura and Paulina were never afraid to speak their mind and Laura, especially, never took no for an answer "in the best way."</p><p>Her inspiration to pursue her interests in human rights and justice, eventually leading to her&nbsp;Latin Grammy Cultural Foundation ambassadorship, also came from her mother.</p><p>"My mom leads with love, kindness and empathy in everything that she does, and I strive to follow her example," Carson asserted.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Laura taught her that nothing is impossible and she is now achieving what she might have once thought was impossible for a Colombian girl from Florida.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaKufm7aiecKaqaynnqh6sa3RnqWtq16dwa64</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fsofia-carsons-parents-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fsofia-carsons-parents-html.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fsofia-carsons-parents-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fsofia-carsons-parents-html.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fsofia-carsons-parents-html.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fsofia-carsons-parents-html.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./jennifer-aniston-jon-hamm-porsche-nyc-morning-show-photos.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./jennifer-aniston-jon-hamm-porsche-nyc-morning-show-photos.html>Jennifer Aniston &amp;amp; Jon Hamm Drive In A Porsche Filming Morning Show Hollywood Life</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./john-j-zillmer.html>Fame | JOHN J ZILLMER net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./john-j-zillmer.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
