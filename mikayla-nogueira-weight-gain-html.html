She took to TikTok to share a three-minute video with her over 11.8 million followers.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-8 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span><p>There, she revealed she had recently gone through 60 pounds of weight gain and noted that it was difficult for her to accept her new body.</p><p>Nogueira said it was “really scary” to weigh 200 pounds on her 4’11&nbsp;frame. However, she added she was going to learn to love her body the way it was. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>She then explained the first step to learning to love her new body was getting a brand new wardrobe, as her previous clothes did not fit her anymore. Nogueira then tried on various outfits she got from Lulu’s and Pink Lily.</p><p>“I’m going to show you guys that you can wear whatever the f*** you want if your a size 2 or size 20,” she said. “It doesn’t matter, wear what makes you happy.”&nbsp;</p><h2>Mikayla Nogueira on her Weight Gain & Struggles</h2><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span><p>Nogueira is taking a positive approach to her weight gain. She has always been very open about her <a href=# rel="follow noopener">struggles</a> with eating disorders and bulimia. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>“I struggle with an eating disorder. I’m really working to overcome it and this is really difficult for me,” she said.</p><p>At the beginning of 2022, Nogueira shared that she had been battling bulimia for over seven years and had been constantly in and out of remission.</p><p>The TikTok star also revealed that her worst phase of struggling with <a href=# rel=follow>eating disorders</a> and bulimia started in January 2021. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>“I relapsed in January 2021 and unfortunately, I was not able to be free of that relapse until December 2021,” she shared. “It was the longest I had gone without being clean.”</p><p>Nogueira then noted that her eating disorders had taken many things from her, including her joy, relationships, and her health. However, she was determined to turn it around and pledged to herself to get her health back in 2022.</p><p>“I’m taking my health back. I’m going to take care of myself in 2022 and always going forward.” <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>Facing Her Insecurities</h2><p>Aside from encouraging people to love their body no matter the size and weight gain, Nogueira also talked a little about her insecurities in the aforementioned TikTok video.</p><p>While trying on the new outfits she had gotten for herself, Nogueira took a liking to a two-piece floral dress despite it exposing her arms, which she revealed was her “biggest insecurity.”</p><p>She described her arms as being “large and in charge,” before saying she couldn’t allow her insecurity to stop her from wearing “really cute clothes like this.”</p><p></p><p><strong>Mikayla Nogueira got candid about her weight gain and insecurities during her TikTok video.</strong> (Source: <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">TikTok</a>)</p><p>Nogueira’s willingness to share her vulnerabilities and encourage others to love themselves has earned her a lot of support.</p><p>Thousands of fans and other well-known personalities have since shown their appreciation for her actions. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>“This is so powerful,” a user wrote. “I’ve had such a hard time throwing away old clothes after I gained weight, but I think it’s time for a new summer wardrobe!”</p><p>Fellow TikTok star Abbie Herbert, who has over 12.7 million followers, also left a comment saying Nogueira was “glowing.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaKWZoK66uMBmpaifpZq2s62MsJyin5ipeqityKdloaydoQ%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fmikayla-nogueira-weight-gain-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fmikayla-nogueira-weight-gain-html.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fmikayla-nogueira-weight-gain-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fmikayla-nogueira-weight-gain-html.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fmikayla-nogueira-weight-gain-html.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fmikayla-nogueira-weight-gain-html.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./lindsey-vonn-nude-colored-bikini-tulum-see-pics.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./lindsey-vonn-nude-colored-bikini-tulum-see-pics.html>See Pics Hollywood Life</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./carter-hastingss-girlfriend-list.html>Carter Hastingss Girlfriend: Who is Carter Hastings Dating?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./carter-hastingss-girlfriend-list.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
