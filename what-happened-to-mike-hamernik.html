Beloved meteorologist <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Mike Hamernik</a> died on Mar. 10, 2021, at age 60. Viewers have since wondered: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">What happened</a> to Mike?</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What happened to Mike Hamernik?</h2><p>An announcement by Mike's sister Kathleen was <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">posted to his Twitter account</a> to let viewers know he had died.</p><p>The tweet also said that he had been struggling with lung cancer, and read, "I am Mike’s sister, Kathleen; I am here with the heart-breaking news that our dear meteorologist died this morning from lung cancer. &nbsp;He was home, surrounded by love and at peace. Please know he cherished all of you, his Twitter followers & weather enthusiasts."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Mike will be severely missed by the WGN Weekend morning team. He was a meteorologist in the Chicago area since 2002, and got his start on CLTV. Mike's passion for meteorology started at the tender age of 6, when WGN reported a microburst felled a large elm tree on his family's block. By age 8, he was collecting weather maps given to him by Chicago meteorologist Harry Volkman.</p><p>It turns out that working for WGTV ran in the family. Harry was able to give Mike the weather maps through Mike's father, Donald, who worked at WGTV as a staff musician for Bozo’s Circus and Artists’ Showcase. This lifelong fondness and interest in the weather generated many fans of Mike's work, only adding to the great loss WGTV staff felt as they remembered their friend and co-worker on Mar. 13, 2021.&nbsp;</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>During several <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">tributes to Mike featured on WGN</a>, Chief Meteorologist Tom Skilling was quoted as telling the fellow meteorologist, "When I want to watch a weather show, it’s your show I watch." Morning Team member Tonya Francisco also commended her former teammate, saying he was an excellent forecaster and "If Mike said [weather] was going to happen, it was going to happen."&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Tom Skilling also <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">posted a separate Facebook tribute</a>, which shed light on how much Mike had been struggling during his final weeks. Tom writes, "He had been coughing so violently in recent months, I had feared something was very wrong. Yet Mike was very private. He never let on how serious the situation with his health had become."&nbsp;</p><p>Tom concluded with a simple statement that described how all viewers must feel about Mike's passing. "We're going to miss our dear friend and colleague, Mike Hamernik at WGN. I've seen few in my years in this business who possessed Mike's work ethic. He was a hard worker and worked every shift in the book, whether morning, evening or late night."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><span>Source: Twitter</span></figure><p>To Kathleen, Mike's sister, and to all the loved ones he left behind, he will be sorely missed.
