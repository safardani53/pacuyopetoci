<time>17 May 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>A TOP driving instructor has revealed the seven most common reasons learners fail their test.</p><p>Ian Fido, head of training at <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">RED Driving School</a>, said delays due to Covid have put pressure on learner drivers to take their tests as soon as possible.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/NINTCHDBPICT000472913074.jpg><p>But rushing in and failing will only dent your confidence.</p><p>Ian told The Sun: "With the delays in being able to book a driving test there is increasing pressure on&nbsp;learners&nbsp;to pass first time.</p><p>"For those who were able to&nbsp;take their tests last year,&nbsp;the pass rate&nbsp;was just over half&nbsp;(50.5 per cent)&nbsp;according to&nbsp;the&nbsp;Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency (DVSA)."</p><p>Ian has revealed the most common errors he has seen when learners fail their driving test.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">most read in motors</h2></p><h2>Taking a test when you are not ready</h2><p>To really nail a driving test, you have to know the in's and out's of the road.</p><p>Winging it in hope that you will pass isn't going to help you, especially if you haven't fully grasped the basics.</p><p>Ian said: "One of the most common stories I hear from pupils following a failed<br>driving test is that they knew they weren’t quite ready but thought they would just ‘give it go’.</p><p>"Often their driving confidence takes a real knock because of this experience."</p><h2>Be prepared</h2><p>Always ask your instructor what will happen on the day.</p><p>Knowing what it is in store will help ease your mind and relax before what can be a daunting day.</p><p>Ian gave us a list of the things you must have on the day with you.</p><p>They include:</p><ul><li>Your UK <a href=#>driving licence</a></li><li>Your theory test pass certificate</li><li>A face covering, unless you have a good reason not to wear one</li><li>A car - most people use their driving instructor's, but you can use your own car if it meets the rules</li></ul><p>Other little things to keep in mind are going to the toilet before the test starts, having a little snack to give you a boost and keep hydrated.</p><h2>Take a practice test</h2><p>Before taking the real thing, Ian recommends that all learner drivers <a href=#>take a practice test.</a></p><p>In school, most students will take mock tests before doing the real thing so why should it be different when it comes to driving.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">The Best Sun Exclusives</h2></p><p>He said: "This will help any learner driver to gain useful experience of what the test feels like and an appraisal of their current driving against the test standard."</p><p>The DVSA also realises the benefits and it tells its learner drivers to do a mock test.</p><h2>Brush up on your road signs</h2><p>While revising for a theory test, drivers will learn all about the different traffic signs on the roads.</p><p>That knowledge should then be reflected when you are at the wheel.</p><p>Failing to do so could mean you are a hazard on the road and it will look less likely that you would pass your test.</p><p>Ian said: "Understanding road signs is an integral part of the theory test – now you must put this into practice for the practical test, reacting appropriately to all traffic and road signs.</p><p>"Common mistakes include going at the wrong speed."</p><h2>Observe your surroundings</h2><p>A vital part of driving is being <a href=#>aware of your surroundings</a> and making surely you completely observations safely.</p><p>Examples of poor observation are if a learner approaches a junction too quickly, doesn't take the right amount of time to observe a situation around them or fails to give car to other motorists on the road.</p><p>Ian said: "Highest on the list every year for driving test faults is poor observation at a junction.</p><p>"You will be given a fault if you emerge from a junction without completing ‘effective observation’ before doing so."</p><h2>Move off safely</h2><p>Before moving, you should be checking your surroundings to make sure you moving on isn't going to cause an accident.</p><p>Ian said: "You must be able to move off safely while making the correct observations from a number of locations.</p><p>"These include the side of the road, on a slope or hill or from behind a parked vehicle.</p><p>"Instances which wouldn’t be deemed safely moving off could include not checking for blind spots or moving off from behind a parked vehicle into the path of an approaching vehicle."</p><h2>Check your mirrors</h2><p>Learner drivers should be making a habit of checking their mirrors often.</p><p>Many new drivers will forget to check the mirrors, especially when turning.</p><p>This means they won't be checking all that's around them, making them a danger to the road.</p><p>Looking in the mirrors helps spot those that could be blind to the eye on first look such as cyclists and motorcyclist.</p><p>Ian said: "You will receive a fault if you forget to check your mirrors before changing direction or if you check your mirrors whilst changing direction.</p><p>"It is vital to remember that the appropriate mirrors must be checked before turning and not during or after."</p><p>Elsewhere, a RED driving instructor advised Sun readers on&nbsp;<a href=#>how to pass their test</a>, including avoiding coffee before the assessment.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>Plus, keep up to date with the latest&nbsp;<a href=#>Highway Code</a>&nbsp;changes coming into place this weekend.</p><p>And, learner drivers could risk a <a href=#>£200 fine and six penalty points</a> for missing this off their car.</p><img
