As a result, the young Brit loved football from very early on in his life.</p><p>Growing up, Mount had an insatiable thirst for football despite the family asking him to focus more on education.</p><p>Surprisingly, the&nbsp; English player managed to do well in school and football.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Mason-Mount-childhood.jpg><p>Nonetheless, everyone knew Brit’s passion for football as Mason practiced regularly, morning or evening.</p><p>Consequently, the Portsmouth native played for a local academy, <strong>Boarhunt</strong>, and impressed many spectators in no time.</p><p>Call it fate or call it a chance, the opportunity came knocking when one such onlooker was none other than a Chelsea scout.</p><p>Subsequently, Mount signed for the <strong>Chelsea Football Club</strong> youth team at six in <strong>2005</strong>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/mount-041.jpg><p>During his time at the academy, Mason met his idols like <strong>Ashley Cole, John Terry, <a href=#>Frank Lampard</a></strong>, <a href=#><strong>David Luiz</strong></a>, etc.</p><p>As an aspiring player, the young midfielder gobbled every ounce of knowledge the legends would impart to him.</p><p>Eventually, Mount’s dream would come to fruition when the English made a competitive debut for the London-based club.</p><p>Similarly, the surreal moment came after 14 years when he initially signed as a six-year-old.</p><h2>Mason Mount: Career (Club & Country)</h2><p>Mason is relatively young, at just 27 years old.</p><p>However, the young Chelsea prospect did not deter his aim and was ready to move abroad on loan to collect valuable experience.</p><p>Moreover, the attacking midfielder has incredible stats in such a short career. For instance, Mount doesn’t fail to find the net regardless of the club he plays.</p><p>It’s like the English player embeds a homing missile every time he touches the ball.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/mount-042.jpg><h3>Dutch club: Vitesse</h3><p>Chelsea academy recognized Mason as a top prospect upon graduation.</p><p>Additionally, the young Brit could showcase game-changing ability while exhibiting a natural flair for goalscoring.</p><p>Therefore, Mount joined the Dutch club <strong>Vitesse </strong>on a season-long loan to fulfill his potential.</p><p>The England international made his first-team debut against AZ Alkmaar on August 26, 2017,&nbsp;as a substitute late in the game.</p><p>However, Mason had to wait another month to make a starting debut. Although the team lost on penalties, the Chelsea attacker impressed his manager.</p><p>After that, Mount scored his first goal for the club in a 1-1 home draw against Utrecht in the 76th minute.</p><p>In particular, the English midfielder made several memories in the Vitesse Jersey. None more so than his first hat-trick in a European play-off semi-final against ADO Den Haag.</p><p>Afterward, Mount scored again to win 2-1 at home in the second leg, putting his team in first place on aggregate with 7-3.</p><p>The Chelsea attacker’s performance was laudable as he netted the goal 14 times in a collective 39 appearances for the Dutch side.</p><p>Accordingly, the Portsmouth-born attacker frequently appeared in the Eredivisie Team of the Week.</p><p>Soon enough, Mount went on to win the <strong>Vitesse Player of the Year</strong> during his one-year stay at the club.</p><h3>Championship club: Derby County</h3><p>The following year Mount joined Championship club Derby County on another season-long loan.</p><p>It didn’t come as a surprise when the young midfielder scored his debut goal in the 60th minute.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/mount-044.jpg><p>Unfortunately, the England international became sidelined for two months due to a hamstring injury sustained during an FA Cup game against Accrington Stanley.</p><p>After a successful recovery, Mount came back with a bang.</p><p>The Brit registered a hat-trick against Bolton Wanderers in a <strong>4-0</strong> win. Mount ended up with a tally of 11 goals and six assists for Derby that season.</p><p>Chelsea was monitoring Mason’s growth in the Championship. Thus, the London club was eager to extend Mount’s contract.</p><p>It would ultimately lead to his debut against rivals Manchester United in August of 2019.</p><p>The English attacker, like any other, dreamt of scoring a goal in the Blues’ jersey.</p><p>Indeed, the dream came to life when he scored against Leicester City and ended the game in a 1-1 draw.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/mount-045.jpg><p>The young midfielder is flourishing in Chelsea colors as he is a regular starter for the first team.</p><p>It is mainly because of <a href=#><strong>Frank Lampard</strong></a>, Mount’s manager at Derby County.</p><p>Under the guidance of his childhood hero, Lampard, Mason has become an extremely potent attacker.</p><p>As such, the Portsmouth native is living up to the expectations as he found the back of the net five times and assisted five times.</p><p><a href=#><strong>If you are interested in buying Mount’s jerseys, click here>></strong></a></p><h3>International Career</h3><p>In several stages, the Chelsea midfielder, Mason, represented his country, England.</p><p>Mount started playing from the U-16 level and, in due course, for the U-17, U-18, U-19, and U-21 levels.</p><p>Mason was amongst the players that traveled for the 2017 UEFA European U-19 Championship.</p><p>Most importantly, he provided an assist for the winning goal against Portugal and proudly accepted the <strong>Golden Player of the Tournament </strong>at the end.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/mount-043.jpg><p>In like manner, Mount got his first taste of international football as <strong>Gareth Southgate</strong> invited the Chelsea youth to train with the senior team ahead of the 2018 World Cup.</p><p>Mason grew in confidence, which positively impacted his club career as well.</p><p>The midfielder got his official international call-up to the senior team for matches against Croatia and Spain in October 2018.</p><p>Above all, the Portsmouth-born attacker debuted against Bulgaria in a 4-0&nbsp;as a 67th-minute substitute in the <strong>UEFA Euro 2020 </strong>qualifying match.</p><p>Finally, Mason scored his first goal for the senior team on November 17, 2019, against Kosovo in a 4-0 away win.</p><p>It is his only goal in six appearances for the national team. Mount was named to England’s 26-man Euro 2020 squad.</p><p>Following contact with Scotland player Billy Gilmour, Mount was forced to self-isolate on June 22, 2021.</p><p>He tested positive for COVID-19 after England’s 0–0 draw with Scotland at the tournament.</p><h2>Mason Mount: Salary & Net worth</h2><p>Impressively, the English central midfielder earns a staggering <strong>€77,236 per week</strong>.</p><p>If you want to know how much the Chelsea youth makes in a year, then look no further, as I have the information for you right here.</p><p>Furthermore, he makes <strong>£3,952,000 </strong>a year, a large sum of money for a grown-up, let alone a 27 years old&nbsp;boy like Mount.</p><p>Mason’s current net worth is <strong>€21.8 Million (£20 Million). </strong>His current contract with Chelsea expires on June 30, 2024.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/299301722_632110091602286_7423296002525030717_n-819x1024.jpg><p>It is due to Mount’s young age; after all, the Brit is just in a nascent career stage.&nbsp;</p><p>The Brits’ net worth will increase considerably after signing a new contract that keeps the youngster in the club for five years.</p><p>On the contrary, the Chelsea attacker knows how to control expenses as he owns a black sedan when most footballers have luxurious sports cars.</p><p>Granted that Mount lives with his family, we expect him to emancipate himself soon.</p><h2>Mason Mount: Lifestyle & Family</h2><p>The Chelsea midfielder is the youngest of his siblings.
