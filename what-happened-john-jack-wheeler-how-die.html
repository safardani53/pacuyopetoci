Bush and <a href=#>George W. Bush</a>.</p><p>Wheeler "carried out projects for Presidents Carter and Reagan, helped guide Macy’s out of bankruptcy and built 51 schools in Vietnam," says the Post.</p><p>After serving in Vietnam, he co-founded the organization that built the Vietnam Veterans Memorial - known as the Wall - which draws more than five million visitors annually.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2020/10/NINTCHDBPICT000615409481.jpg><h2>Has anyone been arrested in connection to his death?</h2><p>No suspects have been arrested in connection to Wheeler’s death.&nbsp;</p><p>His murder remains unsolved as cops still have no idea whether he ended up dead as a result of either a random or deliberate attack.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2020/10/NINTCHDBPICT000615409473.jpg><h2>What are the theories about his death?</h2><p>The latter part of Wheeler's career was spent working as special assistant to the secretary of the Air Force.</p><p>He was also a national security consultant for the research and development firm Mitre Corp, reports The Washington Post.</p><p>The Vietnam vet had "forged an interest in cybersecurity, a remarkable professional turn for a man in his 60s," after a "decades-long battle with depression and bipolar disorder, which triggered bouts of frenetic activity and dramatic mood swings", the paper adds.</p><p>Wannabe sleuths have for ten years drawn their own conclusions about Wheeler's death.</p><p>And there have been quite a few clues to ponder.</p><p>For example, surveillance footage showed him in Wilmington before he was killed.</p><p>The CCTV clip shows an upset and confused Wheeler, looking scruffy and seeking a ride out of the town while complaining that he’d been robbed.</p><p>His wife, Kathy Klyce, told The News Journal: "I think he was afraid. I don't think he was acting abnormal."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2020/10/NINTCHDBPICT000615409492.jpg><p>She said that despite making "lots of enemies" while involved in national defense and the Vietnam Veterans Memorial there was "nobody that would kill him".</p><p>Former homicide investigator Brad Garrett told ABC News: “So the question for investigators is, does it all really go together or is it pieces?</p><p>"When I say pieces, did he have a stroke, for example? Becomes disoriented, he wanders around. He hits into the wrong crowd. They kill him. They rob him, whatever they might do.”</p><p>Yet Klyce disputes that version, pointing out that his body was found with expensive jewelry, including his Rolex watch.</p><p>Hours before his death Wheeler had emailed Mitre, saying his home had been broken into, and his cellphone, badge, key fob and briefcase were stolen.</p><p>He had told Klyce that he needed to spend a couple of days working at Mitre - leaving her feeling "ticked off".</p><p>The couple then argued for a couple of days by text and email exchanges, before Wheeler failed to reply.</p><p>At the Wheelers' second home, in New Castle, Delaware, on the night of December 28, a neighbor spotted the silhouette of a man appearing to ignite material, to allegedly try and set light to a home under construction.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2020/10/NINTCHDBPICT000615409482.jpg><p>Wheeler had apparently battled the building of the three-story house, saying it was sited on an area of historical significance as Colonists, and then the Revolutionaries, had maintained a defensive battery there, writes the Post.</p><p>"The alleged arson attempt added to the mystery," the paper adds.</p><p>Also puzzling is that, on the morning of December 30, a neighbor noticed that - despite the couple being away - an upstairs window and side door were both open.</p><p>Rob Dill told the Post: “My first thought was that there was a break-in."</p><p>Inside, he found an overturned dining room chair, broken dishes in the sink, spices and bottles spread over the counter, and Wheeler’s West Point cadet sword, a prized possession, "on the floor, unsheathed", says the paper.</p><p>Oddly, among the mess was one glaring object - a book which featured Wheeler, The Long Gray Line, was lying open on the kitchen counter.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">MORE UNSOLVED MYSTERIES</h2></p><h2>When is Unsolved Mysteries airing?</h2><p>Netflix released <a href=#>Unsolved Mysteries</a> Volume 2 on Monday, October 19.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>The show’s second volume will feature six new episodes.</p><p>Season one is still available to watch on the streaming site.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2hpZmmEdYWRaK6hmaRitaK8z56lnpxdn7ypuoyjmJyjXay1prHLnqlmoJ%2BseqW1xGg%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhat-happened-john-jack-wheeler-how-die.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwhat-happened-john-jack-wheeler-how-die.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwhat-happened-john-jack-wheeler-how-die.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwhat-happened-john-jack-wheeler-how-die.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhat-happened-john-jack-wheeler-how-die.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-happened-john-jack-wheeler-how-die.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./daniella-monet-harry-styles-girlfriend-coldplay-concert.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./daniella-monet-harry-styles-girlfriend-coldplay-concert.html>5 Facts About Victorious Actress Hollywood Life</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./stephanie-pratt-response-george-floyd-protests-looters-reaction.html>Stephanie Pratts Response To George Floyd Protests Gets Backlash Hollywood Life</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./stephanie-pratt-response-george-floyd-protests-looters-reaction.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
