It has been almost 12 years since the two got married. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>They often post about each other on their social media and gush how much they love one another. Moreover, their love has been amplified by their two children.&nbsp;</p><h2>Who Is Chris Webber's Wife Erika Dates?</h2><p>There is not much known about Webber's spouse. However, according to <a href=# rel="follow noopener">Just Richest</a>, she was born on January 30, 1972, in the USA&nbsp;and raised there.&nbsp;</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span> <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p><strong>Chris Webber and his wife, Erika Dates, posing for a picture.</strong> (Source: <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Instagram</a>) <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-169 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Similarly, there is no information about her parents and siblings.&nbsp;But she has posted about them on social media in the past, which is now&nbsp;private.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Unlike her husband, Dates is not much in the limelight and works behind the scene. She is a social worker and has an organization&nbsp;that benefits others.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>She founded the Social Butterflies Organization with her co-founder, LaKeacha Jett.

But unfortunately, they could not for eight years because of Dates' fertility problems.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>She had uterine fibroids, which according to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Mayo Clinic</a>, are&nbsp;"noncancerous growths of the uterus that often appear during childbearing years."</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Regardless, Webber and his wife never gave up.&nbsp;Eventually, the couple was pregnant with twins.</p><p>They welcomed their children, son Mayce and daughter Elle, into their family on June 5, 2017. Webber took to Twitter to announce the birth of his kids.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>He posted a picture holding the twins and opened up about how difficult it was for them in the past. He said they had "more than a few heartbreaks" before welcoming the children.&nbsp;</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>So thankful. After many years of trying and more than a few heartbreaks we were blessed with these little ones. Thank you @mrserikawebber <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">pic.twitter.com/6Prf5WDWtj</a> â€” Chris Webber (@realchriswebber) <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">June 4, 2017</a></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>He thanked his wife as well for blessing their family with twins. He also took to Instagram to post about the birth of his kids.&nbsp;</p><p>There, he said that after waiting for all these years, the duo was "double blessed." He also noted never to "underestimate the power of prayer" even if people tell things are impossible.&nbsp;However, the post has since been deleted.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>The former NBA player talked about their struggle in an interview with <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Black Doctor</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>He gushed about his kids and said it was "the best feeling in the world" to have them. Even though he did not get sleep after the twins, he did not mind it since the NBA star&nbsp;had a big family as a child where he did babysitting.&nbsp;</p><p>Overall, Webber and his family seemingly live a comfortable life. He often shares about them on his social media, where it is evident that they are living their best lives.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-175 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaJ%2BVqXq1u4ykpaivXZu8s7nEq2SnmpFiva2t2J6pZpuYp7a0edaemZudomLAbsPIn5xmnaKeuKJ5w5qrnqtdlrulecWapKKkqWO1tbnL</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fget-to-know-former-nba-player-chris-webber-s-wife-erika-dates-and-family-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fget-to-know-former-nba-player-chris-webber-s-wife-erika-dates-and-family-html.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fget-to-know-former-nba-player-chris-webber-s-wife-erika-dates-and-family-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fget-to-know-former-nba-player-chris-webber-s-wife-erika-dates-and-family-html.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fget-to-know-former-nba-player-chris-webber-s-wife-erika-dates-and-family-html.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fget-to-know-former-nba-player-chris-webber-s-wife-erika-dates-and-family-html.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./joe-joyce-christian-religion-ethnicity.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./joe-joyce-christian-religion-ethnicity.html>Is Joe Joyce Christian Or Muslim Or Jewish?
