Some of the most prominent ones include actors like late&nbsp;River Phoenix&nbsp;and John Patrick Walker. However, she never actually got around to marrying any of her former partners. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><h2>Martha Plimpton Might&nbsp;Settle Down Soon</h2><p>It is not like she will never get married, quite the opposite is true, actually. The 50-year-old actress&nbsp;has admitted that she does want to settle down eventually. It is just that in her life, a lot of other things have always taken precedence and somehow the idea of marriage has been pushed to the back.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>I would like to settle down and get married and have a family, and I probably will very soon. But for me, I guess, other things always seemed more important.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Reportedly, the last romantic relationship she was in was with a mysterious non-actor man. The two also took a trip together to India.&nbsp;</p><h2>Martha Plimpton Is An Active Abortion-Rights Activist</h2><p>Plimpton is the co-founder of a non-profit organization called&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">A Is For</a>. The organization works towards reproductive rights and ending the stigma associated with abortion.&nbsp;Plimpton and the other artists are&nbsp;extremely passionate about this right.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>She also wears a scarlet letter A for all her interviews. In a YouTube video, she revealed the reason for this. The letter represents that abortion is a part of healthcare and a safe procedure at that. Moreover, she stated that just because a woman gets&nbsp;pregnant, she does not become the property of the state.&nbsp;Hence, women should be allowed to make that decision for themselves. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>In an interview with <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">The Guardian</a>, she was asked about the recent vote in Alabama to ban abortion. She expressed how enraged she was about it. More than anything, she was terrified for the women of the country because it would not be restricted only to Alabama.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-169 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><h2>Martha Plimpton Was Slammed for Her 'Best Abortion' Comment</h2><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Back in June 2017, the Goonies actress made a comment&nbsp;in a Q&A session at a #ShoutYourAbortion event that caused a huge uproar a couple of months later. She said that she had her first abortion in Seattle back when she was 19 and added,&nbsp;</p><p>Notice I said 'first'...and I don’t want Seattle — I don’t want you guys to feel insecure, it was my best one.&nbsp;Heads and tails above the rest. If I could Yelp review it, I totally would.&nbsp;And if that doctor’s here tonight, I don’t remember you at all, I was 19. I was 19, but I thank you nonetheless.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>It was the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">"best abortion" bit that caught fire</a>. Now, Plimpton did not mention who was the father to the fetus, but it remains public knowledge that Martha Plimpton was dating River Phoenix, <a href=# rel=follow>Joaquin Phoenix</a>'s brother,&nbsp;when she was 19.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_5"></span><p>Martha Plimpton and&nbsp;River Phoenix shared screens in multiple movies, the most famous one being&nbsp;Running On Empty.</p><h2><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-5 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Martha Plimpton Has Accomplished A Lot From A Young Age</h2><p>Born in the world of showbiz, her main priority has always been her&nbsp;career. No wonder she has a plethora of <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">achievements</a> to prove that.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>In 1996, she was nominated for the prestigious Joseph Jefferson&nbsp;Award for Actress in a Supporting Role in a Play&nbsp;for her role in The Libertine.&nbsp;In 2001, she was nominated for the same award in the category of&nbsp;Actress in a Principal Role in a Play for Hedda Gabler.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>In 2007, she was awarded&nbsp;the Drama Desk Award&nbsp;and the Outer Critics Circle Award&nbsp;for her exceptional performance in&nbsp;The Coast of Utopia. For the same performance, she&nbsp;was also nominated for the 2007 Tony Award&nbsp;(New York City) for Supporting or Featured Actress in a Play. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-171 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>In 2008 and 2009, she was also nominated for two Tony Awards&nbsp;(New York City), one for Supporting or Featured Actress in a Play&nbsp;for Top Girls and another for Best Performance for a Featured Actress in a Musical&nbsp;for Pal Joey.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGipnqSRqbawutKhoKlnnZa%2FtbTAZqeloZ2lwbC6jKugr52iYr2pu8SnoLFmmKm6rQ%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fmartha-plimpton-river-phoenix-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fmartha-plimpton-river-phoenix-html.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fmartha-plimpton-river-phoenix-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fmartha-plimpton-river-phoenix-html.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fmartha-plimpton-river-phoenix-html.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fmartha-plimpton-river-phoenix-html.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./gael-garcia-bernal-cassandro-trailer-exclusive-7644339.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./gael-garcia-bernal-cassandro-trailer-exclusive-7644339.html>See Gael Garca Bernal in Cassandro Trailer (Exclusive)</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./lorne-peterson.html>Fame | Lorne Peterson net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./lorne-peterson.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
