The entire thing has turned into one long back-pat for contemporary feminists.</p><p>They congratulate each other on the new books they’ve written about the gender-stereotyping of shampoo ads, tweet each other inspirational quotes and whinge to anyone who will listen about that one time some loser said something a bit filth to them online.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/nintchdbpict000390840501.jpg><p><span>If you stopped your average woman on the street today and asked her what day it was, she’d probably tell you it’s Thursday.&nbsp;</span><span>International Women’s Day is not something normal women care about.</span></p><p><span>In fact, it would be more accurate to call the 8th of March International Middle-Class Women Who Have Nothing Better To Do Day.</span></p><p><span>Perhaps this is because feminism is so wildly out of touch with the majority of women’s lives today.</span></p><p><span>A quick look at what feminists got up to in 2018 alone shows just how tired, snobby and frankly boring contemporary feminists have become.</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/nintchdbpict000389699142.jpg><p><span>Take the endless war over the pay gap. The recent non-scandal hyped up by certain BBC journalists is a perfect example of the elitism of today’s feminists, crying sexism because they were missing a few numbers off their already inflated wages.</span></p><p><span>Carrie Gracie, the BBC journalist who became famous for quitting in protest of her supposed pay inequality, didn’t seem too interested in talking about the difference between her fat pay cheque and the slim pickings the woman who cleans her office gets.</span></p><p><span>Most normal, working women are concerned with gaining better wages for BOTH sexes (working men have families to support too).</span></p><p><span>But today’s media feminists seem only interested in talking about equality when it’s used to bargain a better deal for themselves.</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/nintchdbpict000390840500.jpg><p><span>And what about the ongoing sexual harassment panic? The #MeToo movement is alive and well and claiming scalps more than half a year after the Harvey Weinstein exposé broke.</span></p><p><span>Feminists now argue that women are at risk from sexual misconduct from the minute they walk in the door each morning.</span></p><p><span>We’ve seen men sacked for knee-touching, texting and ‘inappropriate conduct’.</span></p><p><span>For International Women’s Day, some feminists are even claiming wolf whistles should be criminalised as a hate crime.</span></p><p><span>What’s </span><i><span>wrong</span></i><span> with these women? Are they all hermits? Most women will tell you that problems of sexism in the workplace are largely a thing of the past, precisely because bolshy, mouthy women have argued for and won freedom and equality in the office.</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/nintchdbpict000389690886.jpg><p><span>And as for the handful of men who still take delight in shouting ‘oy oy’ from car windows, who cares?</span></p><p><span>We’re are able to deal with the rare cases of laddish behaviour - some women even like it.</span></p><p><span>Victim-obsessed feminism wants to paint us all as wilting wallflowers, but I’m pretty sure all the women I know would be offended by that ugly stereotype.</span></p><p><span>And if modern feminist causes aren’t offensive, they’re irrelevant - such as discussing the fact that women still hide tampons up their sleeves on the way to the loo (formally known as period stigma), or waxing lyrical about the need to tackle body shaming by having more plump women in advertising.</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/nintchdbpict000390758590.jpg><p><span>International Women’s Day is useful for one thing only: revealing how middle-class and moronic modern feminism has become. Far from a movement to fight for women’s political needs (like abortion rights and childcare), feminism today is just a label worn by a clique of the political and media class.</span></p><p><span>As for the rest of us, we’ll spend IWD like we do every other day of the week - not listening to feminist nonsense.</span></p><p><b>Ella Whelan is author of <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">What Women Want: Fun, Freedom and an End to Feminism</a>.</b></p><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">What are the real issues surrounding women?</h3></p><p>There are still battles that women need to win. In Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland draconian laws prevent women from accessing the most basic of abortion services.</p><p>Here in England, abortion is still technically illegal. This means that, by law, women do not have control over their own bodies.</p><p>Access to good quality childcare prevents many women from being able to go back to work after having children, leaving working-class families having to make do on one income.</p><p>And with campaigns to encourage women to breastfeed and parent a certain way, there's never been more pressure on women to be the right kind of mum. These are the barriers women are still facing.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">most read in fabulous</h2></p><p>Here's everything you need to know about <a href=#>International Women's Day</a> - and whether there is an International MEN'S Day.</p><p>We asked six young girls under the age of six <a href=#>what International Women's Day means to them</a>, and what THEIR aspirations are.</p><p>And&nbsp;British Airways celebrated International Women’s Day with an<a href=#> all-female flight</a>… with pilot Carol Vorderman as a guest.</p><span class=article__bc_video-caption>US President Donald Trump admits having respect for women, but he's not a feminist on The Piers Morgan Interview</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jp%2BYm62cpMK0e5RwbHJoZGZ8qa3TnmSipqSav6%2Bt06Kmp5mcYsSwucSnqmacka56prjLmmSwoJWhrq97</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fhate-international-womens-day-ella-whelan.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fhate-international-womens-day-ella-whelan.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fhate-international-womens-day-ella-whelan.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fhate-international-womens-day-ella-whelan.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fhate-international-womens-day-ella-whelan.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fhate-international-womens-day-ella-whelan.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./why-is-atlanta-united-playing-in-kennesaw.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./why-is-atlanta-united-playing-in-kennesaw.html>Atlanta United Is Ready to Take on the Final Rounds of the Championship League</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./wear-a-similar-black-bodysuit-as-kylie-jenner-this-winter-5211028.html>Wear a Similar Black Bodysuit as Kylie Jenner This Winter Hollywood Life</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./wear-a-similar-black-bodysuit-as-kylie-jenner-this-winter-5211028.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
