I don't necessarily need to agree with that. But it's his right.”</p><p>In 2020 Jelana revealed how she has struggled with the public attention she gets from being married toon of the greatest sportsmen of all time.</p><p>She has claimed that being criticised for the way she looks had a negative effect on her, with <a href=#>social media</a> also putting a strain on her life.</p><p>Speaking to&nbsp;<a href=#>Vesti-Online</a>&nbsp;about living in the spotlight, she said: "When you are young, the spotlight and attention certainly feel comfortable.</p><p>“At first, the experience does not alarm you because it can bring you some difficulties. We look at public figures and think that kind of publicity is okay.</p><p>"But as time goes on, you lack anonymity, you lack the privacy to be able to do whatever you like at any time, in any situation.</p><p>“I try to resist all these expectations to always be myself and for&nbsp;<a href=#>Novak</a>&nbsp;to be able to be himself."</p><p>Addressing comments made about her, she added: "That is probably why I am being criticised by the public ‘why didn't I wear makeup’ or ‘why wasn't I always wearing heels’."</p><p>Jelena is also the director of their charity, the Novak Djokovic Foundation, which aims to help children in Serbia realise their dreams by improving the country's education system.</p><h2>Who is Novak Djokovic?</h2><p><a href=#>Novak Djokovic</a> is one of the most famous and successful tennis players in the world, considered among many to be the <a href=#>greatest player of all time</a>.</p><p>The Serbian has won 24 Grand Slam singles titles, including Wimbledon seven times and 10 <a href=#>Australian Open</a> titles.</p><p>After winning the 2016 <a href=#>French Open</a>, Djokovic became the third man to hold all four major titles at once, and the first ever to do so on three different surfaces.</p><p>He is the only man in tennis history to win a triple Career Grand Slam — meaning he has won the US Open, French Open, Australian Open and Wimbledon three times each.</p><p>Novak is also the only player to have won a career Golden Masters — winning all nine active ATP Masters titles — which he has astonishingly managed to do twice.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqynqKqkZIB6fY9ta25nnqTDoreMnaGoo5%2BrtqR51qKdnmWamrmmusBmmqGhnJm%2FprqO</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fnovak-djokovic-wife-jelena-children.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fnovak-djokovic-wife-jelena-children.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fnovak-djokovic-wife-jelena-children.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fnovak-djokovic-wife-jelena-children.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fnovak-djokovic-wife-jelena-children.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fnovak-djokovic-wife-jelena-children.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./what-do-they-eat-on-love-island-and-when-are-meal-times.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./what-do-they-eat-on-love-island-and-when-are-meal-times.html>What do they eat on Love Island and when are meal times?
