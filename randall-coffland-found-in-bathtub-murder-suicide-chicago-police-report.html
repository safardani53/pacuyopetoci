He finally turned the gun on himself on the evening of Friday, Mar. 10. <strong>HollywoodLife.com</strong> EXCLUSIVELY obtained the police report from the St. Charles Police Department. It detailed the horrific night that ended with three dead and a mother in mourning. When the police arrived at the scene an officer said, “I could hear a female screaming from inside,” who was later identified as Anjum.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>911 call from Randall:<br><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/10_mar_2017-911_8-phone-call.wav</a><br>911 call from Anjum:<br><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/10_mar_2017-911_9-phone-call.wav</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-4>Officers found Anjum&nbsp;on the phone, “sitting on the ground in the front hallway of the apartment.” She was “covered in blood that appeared to be coming from her lower body.” Anjum screamed at the police “‘did he killed them?!’ and ‘my babies, where are they?!'”&nbsp;Before a member of law enforcement “grabbed a hold of the first victim from behind and dragged her out the front entrance.” Anjum was taken to&nbsp;Delnor Community Hospital where she was treated for her wounds.</p><h3 class=galleryh1><a href=#>Coffland Family —&nbsp;PICS</a></h3><p id=content-paragraph-5>The police continued into the apartment where they found Brittany and Tiffany already dead. “I&nbsp;also observed a young female [Brittany] deceased on the sofa in the living room covered up to her head with a blanket, she had a pasty colored skin,” one officer noted in the report. “Another young female deceased in a bedroom with an apparent gunshot wound to the head, she was also covered in bed sheet up to her head with blood and matter running down the bed sheet,” an officer said.&nbsp;“She appeared to have been watching a video in her laptop.” That’s such a heartbreaking detail!</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>The first responders discovered Randall’s body last in the&nbsp;bathroom of the master bedroom. The police yelled for Randall to come out and after he did not, they kicked down the door. “Immediately upon kicking the door open, I could smell gun powder,” one officer said in the report and explained,&nbsp;“we saw a male subject floating in the bathtub. The water was completely mixed with blood.” The police found “a single silver shell casing on the bath tub by the faucet and a cell phone on the edge of the tub.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>Anjum later described how the tragedy unfolded while she was recovering from her injuries in the hospital. The police had even responded to a domestic dispute call one month before the murders. The day before the killings, Anjum explained to&nbsp;police that,”she told Randy she wanted divorce after he was telling her he wanted to get back together.” Randy began texting Anjum on Friday morning threatening to kill himself. He continued to text her in the afternoon and asked her to come over because&nbsp;“he had secrets.” Anjum tried to get Randall to reveal his secrets over the phone, but he refused. “Anjum stated Randy scared her but she went over and once upstairs she went in the kitchen,” the report said. Anjum then turned around and saw Randall holding a gun.</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>“She yelled at him asking where he got the gun and why,” the report said.&nbsp;“Anjum stated she asked Randy about the girls and he told her they were already dead.” That was when Randy shot Anjum in the leg and “told her he wanted her to live so she could live with this the rest of her life.” Randy then ran into the bedroom and that was when Anjum said “she saw Brittany on the couch, but didn’t see Tiffany.” Anjum was said to be in&nbsp;“fair” condition, as of Sunday, March 12, according to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The Associated Press</a>.&nbsp;</p><p id=content-paragraph-9><strong>HollywoodLifers</strong>, does this horrific story scare you?
