If you have the capacity to read this blog, then you cannot reject that.”</p><p>&nbsp;<strong>What are some of the things you stand against?</strong></p><p>“Animal abuse. Victim minds. Corporate power.”</p><p><strong>What living person do you admire the most, and why?</strong></p><p>“I have to say two — my parents for the unconditional love and support they provide my brother and me. I couldn’t have asked for two more beautiful people to guide me through life.”</p><p><strong>What living person do you despise?</strong></p><p>“There are plenty of people on this planet who piss me right off, but I like to remind myself they likely just needed a hug when they were three years old and still take it out on the world today. Hug your children, folks.”</p><p><strong>If money were not an object, what profession would you choose?</strong></p><p>“Exactly what I’m doing today – performing, traveling, and writing.

As a kid, I could never be bothered by the likes of Mary Poppins. Instead, you’d find me spinning around the lounge room pretending to be Baby.”</p><p><strong>Musician:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;Alanis Morrisette</p><p><strong>What upsets you the most?</strong></p><p>“That so few people are motivated or confident enough to educate themselves about their mental and physical health.”</p><p>And continue to believe they are victims of their minds and bodies, on a more personal level, living 8,000 miles from my family.</p><p><strong>What bores you?</strong></p><p>“People constantly texting while in the Company of others. I’ve dedicated this time to connect with you, not to stare at your hairline.”</p><p><strong>Do you believe in an afterlife, and why do you believe it so?</strong></p><p>“Heck yes. As if we came here to learn all these daily lessons for almost a century, to disappear? There’s no way this is it. This is just the classroom.”</p><p>&nbsp;<strong>My favorite quality in a man or a woman:</strong></p><p>“Open-mindedness and having the passion for continuously learning about himself and life.”</p><h4><strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Phil Ivey Net Worth: Masterclass, Winnings, Poker Income &amp;#038; Controversy Wiki >></a></strong></h4><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmionJbGpr7Sm6CoZpOkunC42KelZp%2BZobqivtOipWaamaR6pq3RpbBmpJmbsm6vwKucnqpdp7KtrdOipqermJ69brrErWSwp6KptW7DyKSgaA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2flynn-gilmartin-bio-early-life-career-relationship-net-worth-wiki.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2flynn-gilmartin-bio-early-life-career-relationship-net-worth-wiki.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2flynn-gilmartin-bio-early-life-career-relationship-net-worth-wiki.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2flynn-gilmartin-bio-early-life-career-relationship-net-worth-wiki.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2flynn-gilmartin-bio-early-life-career-relationship-net-worth-wiki.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2flynn-gilmartin-bio-early-life-career-relationship-net-worth-wiki.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./sid-blanks.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./sid-blanks.html>Sid Blanks</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./heidi-klums-jessica-rabbit-halloween-costume-2015-photos.html>Heidi Klum's Jessica Rabbit Halloween Costume 2015: Photos</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./heidi-klums-jessica-rabbit-halloween-costume-2015-photos.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
