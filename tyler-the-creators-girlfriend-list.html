The goat year is associated with a pure and gentle heart. They'd rather suffer in silence than dispute and upset someone else's mood. Even in silence, they maintain their own point of view. When it comes to their obsessions, they will go to any length to make their dreams come true. Though kind, goats have a few tricks up their sleeves. They are adept at employing soft power, gently and politely persuading others to their side.</p><p>People born on March 6 have a zodiac sign of <strong>Pisces</strong>. There would almost certainly be an image of Pisces next to the term "psychic" in the dictionary. Pisces is the zodiac's most perceptive, sensitive, and empathic sign, and that's because it's the last of the last. Pisces, as the final sign, has absorbed every lesson taught by the preceding signs, including the pleasures and sorrows, hopes and anxieties. It is represented as two fish swimming in opposite directions, symbolizing Pisces' continual divide of attention between imagination and reality.</p><p>Also known as Wolf Haley, he is best known for being the leader of the alternative rap group, Odd Future. In 2011 he won an MTV Video Music Award for Best New Artist. His father abandoned him, his mother, and his sister, Lynda.
