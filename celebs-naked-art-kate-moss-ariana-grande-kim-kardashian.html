Blowing her kisses and showering her with praises."</p><p>But it was on the cover of her 2019 album Cuz I Love You, wearing nothing but a 42-inch wig, she proved just how much she loved her body.</p><p>The main person involved in creating the photographic artwork was hairstylist Kendall Dorsey - who selected and styled the hair Lizzo wore.</p><p>He explained why Lizzo chose to get naked for the album's artwork.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/NINTCHDBPICT000625894741.jpg><p>He told the Cut: “The shoot was really about her exposing herself as a woman and just being fearless, free, and confident.</p><p>“We landed on creating something that would make her feel like she still had something on, so the hair eventually became&nbsp; the garment.”</p><h2>Celine Dion</h2><p>Fashion and haute couture has always been how Celine Dion shows her love of art.</p><p>But she shocked fans when she took off all her elaborate costumes and posed naked for Vogue in 2017.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/NINTCHDBPICT000336399618.jpg><p>The tasteful picture shows Celine sitting on a chair with her knees and arms strategically placed to hide her modesty.</p><p>Vogue explained the photo was created to depict Celine changing looks between shows.</p><p>The captioned revealed the My Heart Will Go On singer “has worn haute couture near exclusively for her own performances (in Las Vegas and on her current "mini-tour" of Europe),” for the last five years.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/4dc64b52-f4a4-43e9-9a60-42d9bc509034.jpg><p>They also explained: “In Vegas, Velcro panels are added to allow for her ribcage to expand or for a quick outfit change.&nbsp;</p><p>“Micro straps of elasticized chiffon prevent a slit from becoming a sloppy situation mid-squat.”</p><p>Celine added: “We have to make haute couture industrial.</p><p>“The clothes follow me; I do not follow the clothes."&nbsp;</p><h2>Kim Kardashian</h2><p>There's no denying Kim Kardashian has made an art out of posing naked.</p><p>But her most iconic nude picture was for the Paper magazine cover - shot by the legendary Jean Paul Goude.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/NINTCHDBPICT000133253189.jpg><p>In an attempt to #BreakTheInternet, Kim posed from behind, dropping her dress below her bum.</p><p>In the spread, there was also a full-frontal picture of Kim’s naked body.&nbsp;</p><p>When the pictures broke, Kim was tweeted about more than 200,000 times in one day.</p><p>Kim did the shoot after she’d given birth to her and Kanye West’s first child, North West, now seven.</p><p>She wanted to remind herself of her body before she became pregnant with her second child, Saint, now five.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/NINTCHDBPICT000636897560.jpg><p>She told Australia 2Day FM: "[I have] an even better body after having the baby than I did before.</p><p>“I'm very confident about [my body].&nbsp;</p><p>“It was just a little token before I have to go through [pregnancy] again."</p><p>Kim had her youngest two children, Chicago, three, and Psalm, two, via surrogate.</p><h2>Lindsay Lohan</h2><p>Lindsay Lohan has always been a huge fan of Marilyn Monroe.</p><p>In 2008, <a href=#>New York magazine</a> published a series of photos of the Mean Girls actress, recreating the Hollywood legend’s iconic 1962 The Last Sitting series, using the same photographer, Bert Stern.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/NINTCHDBPICT000136172809.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/NINTCHDBPICT000654120886.jpg><p>And, in 2011, Lindsay posed for Playboy imitating a 1949 naked portrait of Marilyn.</p><p>Then, three years later, while living in London, she discovered local street artist Pegasus, after seeing the portrait he’d created of Kylie Minogue.</p><p>She commissioned the artist to paint her Playboy spread, and she clearly loved the result, as she hung the painting in her dressing room at London’s Playhouse Theatre, where she was performing in Speed-the-Plow.</p><p>It was an equally rewarding project for Pegasus, <a href=#>who told the Evening Standard</a>: “I love Lindsay, she is beautiful.&nbsp;</p><p>“She has had such hard times, but comes back even more beautiful. I loved painting her!”</p><h2>Sir Sean Connery</h2><p>Sir Sean Connery was regarded as a hunk throughout his life, having played the iconic James Bond from 1962 to 1983</p><p>And in 2011 a nude oil painting of the late actor, created in 1951, was discovered in the collection of artist Rab Webster.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/NINTCHDBPICT000617638543.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/NINTCHDBPICT000004811585.jpg><p>Rab had been a student at the Edinburgh College of Art when he painted it, and Edinburgh-born Sir Sean would frequently do life modelling for extra cash.</p><p>Richard Demarco, a local artist and promoter, was among those who painted Sir Sean as a young man.</p><p>And he described his popularity with the ladies at the time.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Celebrity</h2></p><p>He told the BBC: "When he modelled there were always lots of girls in the classes because they were attracted by his Adonis-like physique.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>"He was a great inspiration for any artist and was amazing to paint and draw."</p><p>Well, as long as it's all in the name of art!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2hqaWaFcXySaJqepJWXwG66wKScnWWRp8Fut8CtnGaln6jAbq3RopinmV2cv6K6w55kpKGdYriivsOaqqGhkaN8</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fcelebs-naked-art-kate-moss-ariana-grande-kim-kardashian.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fcelebs-naked-art-kate-moss-ariana-grande-kim-kardashian.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fcelebs-naked-art-kate-moss-ariana-grande-kim-kardashian.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fcelebs-naked-art-kate-moss-ariana-grande-kim-kardashian.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fcelebs-naked-art-kate-moss-ariana-grande-kim-kardashian.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fcelebs-naked-art-kate-moss-ariana-grande-kim-kardashian.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./alison-gold-chinese-food-video-worse-than-rebecca-black.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./alison-gold-chinese-food-video-worse-than-rebecca-black.html>Even Worse Than Rebecca Black?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./asda-disney-pyjama-range-adults-favourite-characters.html>Asda has launched a Disney pyjama range for adults for 15 with all the favourite characters</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./asda-disney-pyjama-range-adults-favourite-characters.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
