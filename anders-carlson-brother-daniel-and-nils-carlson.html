Born as the youngest son in the family, Anders considers both his brothers as his early inspirations, who pushed him into making a career in football.</strong></p><p>While Anders and Daniel made it into the NFL, the oldest, Nils, gave up his sports career to focus on his engineering studies. Nevertheless, he served as his college team’s goalkeeping coach in 2015.</p><p>Maybe because they all have similar interests, the Carlson brothers have a great bonding.</p><p>Anders and Daniel admit they would not have been athletes without their oldest brother, Nils.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/American-Professional-Football-Player-Anders-Carlson-e1692691720958.jpg><p>Carlson had initially played college football for the Auburn Tigers, where his older brother, Daniel, played as a <a href=#>placekicker</a>.</p><p>His most significant achievement as a collegiate athlete was getting included in First Team All-SEC and Second Team All-American in 2020.</p><p>Born to Swedish-American parents in Colorado, Anders Carlson is currently a placekicker for the Green Bay Packers of the NFL.</p><h2>Anders Carlson Brother: Daniel And Nils Carlson</h2><p><a href=#>Anders Carlson</a> was born to his parents, Jodie and Hans Carlson, on June 18, 1998, in Colorado Springs, Colorado.</p><p>Besides him, Hans and Jodie had given birth to two sons, Daniel and Nils Carlson.</p><p>Their dad, Hans, was a former athlete. Similarly, their mother, Jodie, worked with the former American football player Bear Bryant for many years.&nbsp;</p><p>Besides, many of their family members were former athletes, including their grandparents, Deacon and Junanita.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/The-Carlson-Brothers-With-Their-Parents-e1692696057160.jpg><p>So, naturally, Anders and his older brothers were drawn to the world of sports at an early age.&nbsp;</p><p>Although born on September 15, 1992, in Texas, Nils Carlson lived in Sweden in his teens and attended high school in Vastra, Sweden, before returning to the United States for higher education.</p><p>Nils later pursued a bachelor’s degree in Aerospace Engineering at the Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University, besides playing college football for their team. However, he never pursued a professional football career.</p><p>Meanwhile, inspired by their older brother, Daniel and Anders began playing football during their childhood and are now both professional athletes.&nbsp;</p><p>Ander’s second oldest brother, Daniel, was born almost three years before him. He attended The Classical Academy in Colorado Springs and later played college football for Auburn Tigers, where his younger brother joined him.</p><p>After graduating, Daniel began playing in the NFL after the Minnesota Vikings chose him in the 2018 draft.</p><h3>More On Anders’ Family And His Brothers’ Marriages</h3><p>The United States residents Hans and Jodie Carlson raised three sons together.&nbsp;</p><p>Among them, their oldest son, Nils, has mostly spent his life in Sweden.&nbsp;</p><p>Nils married his girlfriend, Valerie, on June 23, 2017. Originally from Gothenburg, Sweden, Valerie met Nils while attending the University in the U.S. and fell in love.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Anders-Carlsons-Brother-Nils-And-Sister-In-Law-Valerie-e1692696398956.jpg><p>After marrying, the couple initially moved to Kalmar, Sweden, in 2017.
