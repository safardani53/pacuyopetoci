Men could be beaten, sometimes to death, for minor indiscretions.”</p><p>The real pirates of the Caribbean were far more bloodthirsty than Jack Sparrow in the movies.</p><p>From crew members routinely lashed with whips, beaten and kicked to hostages being disembowelled alive, we look at the grisly life and crimes of real pirates.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/NINTCHDBPICT000641724786.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/NINTCHDBPICT000641728198.jpg><h2>Sadist who revelled in gruesome murders</h2><p>Thought to have grown up in the East End of London, Charles Vane was known for his sadistic streak towards crew and enemy alike.</p><p>In one notorious incident, in 1718, Vane and his crew looted the Bermuda sloop Diamond and viciously beat the captain and crew.</p><p>Vane then singled out one crew member, Nathaniel Catling, to be hung.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/NINTCHDBPICT000641728235.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/NINTCHDBPICT000641738171.jpg><p>Thinking he was dead, they pulled him from the noose but he revived "whereupon one of the pirates hacked him across the collarbone with his cutlass and would have continued until he had murdered him had not one of the other pirates persuaded him it 'was too great a cruelty.'"</p><p>His brutality towards his crew, who he also cheated of the spoils of their raids, meant frequent mutinies and eventually led to his downfall.</p><p>After being shipwrecked on an inhabited island in the Bay of Honduras, Vane was rescued by a ship - only for a former member of his own crew to recognise him and hand him over the authorities.</p><p>Vane was hanged and gibbeted - dipped in tar and hung in a steel cage as a warning to others.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/NINTCHDBPICT000641724788.jpg><h2>Teen wife forced to sleep with crew</h2><p>A close friend and colleague of Vane, Edward Thatch - better known as Blackbeard - revelled in his reputation for brutality.</p><p>A former privateer, who learned his trade aboard the pirate ships of Nassau founder Benjamin Hornigold, Thatch branched out on his own by commandeering a huge French vessel and equipping her with 40 guns. He named her 'Queen Anne's Revenge'.</p><p>Blackbeard instilled fear in crews and captives alike and, while many think his violent reputation was exaggerated, he lived up to the legend with random acts of violence.</p><p>According to contemporary writer Daniel Defoe, he once shot his second-in-command, Israel Hands in the knee under the table during a game of cards, leaving with a limp for life.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/NINTCHDBPICT000641728230.jpg><p>When asked why, he answered that, “if he did not now and then kill one of them, they would forget who he was."</p><p>After obtaining a pardon from the governor of North Carolina, Blackbeard married 16-year-old Mary Ormond, the daughter of a local landowner, in 1718.</p><p>Defoe wrote: “After he had lain all night, it was his custom to invite five or six of his brutal companions to come ashore, and he would force her to prostitute herself to them all, one after another, before his face."</p><p>Blackbeard was decapitated by naval officer Robert Maynard during the capture of his ship, in 1718.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/NINTCHDBPICT000641728351.jpg><h2>Captain's lips cut off and boiled</h2><p>Brought up in a family of criminals, London-born Edward Low moved to Boston and married Eliza Marble, in 1714.</p><p>When Eliza died in childbirth, Low turned to piracy and became known for his brutality, capturing over 100 ships gleefully torturing their crew.</p><p>Victims were cut, whipped, burned and starved to death in an effort to glean information about sunken treasures and ship schedules.</p><p>One of his favourite torture techniques involved tying a victim's hands with rope between their fingers and setting it alight, burning their flesh down to the bones.</p><p>A letter describing one raid on a Portuguese ship claimed Low: "Cut off the said Master's lips and broiled them before his face, and afterwards murdered the whole crew, being thirty-two persons."</p><p>Low was thought to have been caught and hanged by the French.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/NINTCHDBPICT000641741147.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/NINTCHDBPICT000641740197.jpg><h2>Innards nailed to post in deadly 'dance'</h2><p>Known as ‘the exterminator’ for his love of slaughtering the enemy, French buccaneer Daniel Montbars came from a wealthy family but his hatred of the Spanish led him to a life on the high seas.</p><p>After one raid on a Spanish galleon, one witness said he slaughtered numerous crew members, adding: “His only pleasure seemed to be to contemplate, not the treasures of the vessel, but the number of dead and dying Spaniards."</p><p>One particularly gruesome method of murder was cutting open the stomach of his victim, extracting one end of his intestines and nailing it to a post.</p><p>He would then force the man to dance to his death by beating his behind with a burning log.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/NINTCHDBPICT000641741510.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/KH-GRAPHIC-PRIVATES-TIMELINE-PART1.jpg><h2>Female pirate stabbed servant at 13</h2><p>Irish pirate Anne Bonny, the daughter of a lawyer and one of his servants, was dressed as a boy when she was growing up on a Carolina plantation.</p><p>Anne’s mother died when she was 12 and she began to spiral out of control -
