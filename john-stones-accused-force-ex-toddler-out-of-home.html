A source said: “Millie feels she’s being turfed out.”</p><p><a href=#>Stones</a> and childhood sweetheart Millie spent 11 years together and have a young daughter.</p><p>They split in November and he has since been living in a two-bedroom flat.</p><p>But because Stones,&nbsp; 25, owns the six-bedroom home solely, Millie has no option but to leave.</p><p>A source said: “She seems cut up by the way he is behaving.</p><p>“It is like he’s forgotten himself and his roots.</p><p>“She can’t understand why he is acting in such a cruel way.</p><p>“Everything is falling in on her.</p><p>“She has been to see a lawyer who has told her in general terms unmarried partners, no matter how long they have been in the relationship, have few rights.</p><p>“The house and all the other assets which John has accrued during his career are in his name alone.</p><p>“There’s nothing Millie can do. She doesn’t have a leg to stand on so felt she had no option but to agree to leave.</p><p>“She thinks his intention is to get his home back and make a new life with Olivia and her baby while she picks up the pieces.”</p><h2>PARTYING WITH PALS IN IBIZA</h2><p>Stones was said to be “without&nbsp; a care in the world” as he partied&nbsp; with footballer pals in Ibiza last week — before he was due back for training.</p><p>We revealed in May how the £50million player was the<a href=#> subject of dressing room taunts about his new relationship with beautician Olivia</a>.</p><p>The pair met when she was pregnant.</p><p>Earlier this month Stones was widely criticised for&nbsp; two gaffes in <a href=#>England’s 3-1 Uefa Nations League semi-final&nbsp; defeat to the Netherlands</a>.</p><p>Boss Gareth Southgate said after the match that Stones would only return to the team once he “is feeling in a good place and more confident”.</p><p>The source added: “Millie never thought they would split up.</p><p>“She didn’t care about the material things.</p><p>“She just wanted a normal home, normal family and to be happy.</p><p>“Now she feels like she has very few options. John wants his home back and because it is in his name there’s nothing she can do to stop him.</p><p>“Millie’s still in it at the moment but she knows she will have to leave soon and has agreed to do so. Nothing has yet been agreed formally.</p><p>“She feels extremely sad as if she hasn’t done anything wrong and yet she is the one whose life is being turned upside down.</p><p>“There doesn’t seem to be any thought for what they’ve been through together — the years they were a couple, and&nbsp; the child they have. Eleven years together and Millie now seems to mean nothing to him.”</p><p>The source told how Stones changed shortly after he left Everton in August 2016 and signed for Manchester City.</p><p>Just months later he was accused of cheating on Millie with events organiser Jessica Peaty.</p><p>She claimed she romped with the player after meeting at a restaurant.</p><p>Jessica said Stones told her he and Millie had split.</p><p>The defender denied the affair but later had a tattoo of Millie inked on his arm. Millie decided to give him one last chance and did all she could to keep him grounded.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/NINTCHDBPICT000418834797-e1561843727632.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/dk-image-the-baby-1.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/NINTCHDBPICT000415824427.jpg><p>At last summer’s World Cup in Russia the couple were spotted kissing after a match.</p><p>But in November he walked out on her after she brought up the subject of marriage.</p><p>The source added: “As far as Millie is concerned it came out of the blue.</p><p>“There were no signs whatsoever, no build up.</p><p>“They both did what they wanted, rarely&nbsp; argued and had a lovely child in a beautiful home. It was idyllic and the stuff of dreams. Millie says he just flipped saying he needed time away.</p><p>“From that day she says he just cut off everybody.</p><p>“It was instant. Millie went home to her<a href=#> mum and dad</a> and said things weren’t right between them.</p><p>“They suggested she give him a moment and were confident it would blow over. She was upset but&nbsp; put on a brave face.</p><p>“He never really explained why he wanted space.</p><p>“Millie told friends she got very little out of him. The shutters had come down. There was no reasoning or talking to him. It was like he was hiding something.</p><p>“All he kept harping on about was that he needed his freedom and she was left in limbo.</p><p>“Millie felt she had no choice but to seek legal advice.</p><p>“She had no money herself. She had nothing.</p><p>“She needed advice as to how she stood legally.</p><p>“They’d been in a relationship&nbsp; for 11 years. But that would stand for nothing and he would only be legally required to pay child maintenance.”</p><h2>REGULAR ON THE PARTY SCENE</h2><p>The Sun on Sunday understands Stones has been living in a two-bedroom apartment for the past few months.</p><p>Another source said: “John is keen to move back into his own home. It was subsequently then Millie’s decision to move out and as a result the timeframe for that has been mutually agreed between the pair of them.</p><p>“There is no question of John reneging on his commitments.</p><p>“He has provided Millie with a large and luxury budget, and a number of options to purchase a new property for herself.</p><p>“It may be that she initially rents a house while she assesses her options. John is an incredible father and his first priority will always be ensuring the best possible care and life for his daughter.”</p><p>Stones met Millie while at school and the pair began dating at the age of 14, while he was a promising young player for Barnsley.</p><p>Millie was seen as a steadying influence as his career took off.</p><p>New love Olivia was well known on the&nbsp; party scene and a regular at clubs popular with players from City’s rivals Manchester United.</p><p>She ran a popular salon near her Cheshire home until a few months before she gave birth to a&nbsp; son. She is now focusing on being a mum and is often spotted in her new £60,000 Range Rover.</p><p>Last week Stones flew to Ibiza for a booze-fuelled out-of-season break with footballer pals.</p><p>He was seen clutching a bottle of Jägermeister at the island’s trendy Nikki Beach club and downing booze from a&nbsp; £1,000 bottle of rosé.</p><p>At one point Stones poured alcohol into the mouth of&nbsp; England and Watford midfielder Tom Cleverley who was lying&nbsp; on the ground.</p><p>An onlooker said: “John was in very high spirits and was making the most of the party scene. He was swaggering around and didn’t seem to have a care in the world.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">MOST READ IN SPORT</h2></p><p>“He was keen to make the most of his time off before he returns to training.”</p><p>Last season Stones played in just over half of&nbsp; City’s Premier League fixtures.&nbsp; <a href=#>His errors against the&nbsp; Netherlands were&nbsp; branded “stupid” by pundit Jamie Carragher</a>.</p><p>The Times’ Tony Cascarino&nbsp; said of Stones’ performance:&nbsp; “The biggest problem I had was him trying to nutmeg a Holland player in his own 18-yard box.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/NINTCHDBPICT000460523615-3.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/NINTCHDBPICT000495840179-e1561844122338.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/NINTCHDBPICT000489312276-e1561844494820.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/NINTCHDBPICT000500952360-e1561844161952.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/NINTCHDBPICT000500961271.jpg><br><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqynqKqkZIZ1fJJqaGlnmqS1r3nSraannaNirqSv1KycnWWWpL%2BksYyer2asn5mxrbHRZqaurF2ks260zqacaA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fjohn-stones-accused-force-ex-toddler-out-of-home.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fjohn-stones-accused-force-ex-toddler-out-of-home.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fjohn-stones-accused-force-ex-toddler-out-of-home.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fjohn-stones-accused-force-ex-toddler-out-of-home.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fjohn-stones-accused-force-ex-toddler-out-of-home.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fjohn-stones-accused-force-ex-toddler-out-of-home.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./jose-ribalta.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./jose-ribalta.html>Fame | Jos Ribalta net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./who-is-raissa-gerona-dating.html>Who is Raissa Gerona Dating Now</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./who-is-raissa-gerona-dating.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
