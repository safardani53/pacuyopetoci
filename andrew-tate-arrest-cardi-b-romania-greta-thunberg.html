"Cardi's is go do drugs, f*** random men and go through life as a braindead moron."</p><p>But in a since-deleted tweet, Cardi hit back at Shields, writing: "I’m married, I don’t smoke weed, I don’t pop pills, I don’t do coke, I’m a mom of two kids and I do a lot of charity work…but hey let me put cardi into it to defend a man who defend misogyny and rape."</p><p>Controversial influencer Tate initially gained fame after a short-lived appearance on Big Brother.</p><p>He was&nbsp;dumped from the reality show&nbsp;after alleged footage of him beating a woman emerged online.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Showbiz</h2></p><p>Since then he has sparked revulsion and outrage with a wave of content online.</p><p>The Washington DC-born Tate has been accused of spreading hate towards women as he built his profile.</p><p>He was banned from Twitter in 2017 for violating its terms of service with his controversial comments but has since <a href=#>had his account reinstated following Elon Musk's takeover</a>.</p><p>Tate has previously referred to women as "property" and said they should bear "some responsibility" if they are sexually assaulted.</p><p>This is what happens when you don't recycle your pizza boxes</p><span class=quote-credit>Greta Thunberg</span><p>In August, <a href=#>Tate was banned from a range of other&nbsp;social media&nbsp;sites</a> over a string of disturbing rants about women.</p><p>TikTok&nbsp;banned him for misogyny, while Meta said he violated their policies around "Dangerous Individuals and Organisations".</p><p>He is also banned on&nbsp;YouTube.</p><p>Tate has denied accusations of misogyny and claimed that many of his clips are "taken out of context".</p><p>Now, in the wake of <a href=#>Tate's arrest in Romania over human trafficking allegations</a>, Cardi B has appeared to revel in his downfall.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/andrew-tate-responds-greta-thunberg-785547393.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/andrew-tate-responds-greta-thunberg-785547387.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/andrew-tate-tristan-tate-escorted-785501675.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/www-instagram-com-cobratate-754145349.jpg><p>First, she shared a link to an article on Tate's arrest, tweeting simply: "Well well well..."</p><p>She later posted a single image of Greta with the simple caption "IDC" (I don't care).</p><p>Tate started a row with the young Swedish environmentalist earlier this week after he attempted to <a href=#>troll her about his car collection</a>.</p><p>The&nbsp;<a href=#>kickboxer</a>&nbsp;tried to taunt the climate change campaigner by bragging about the "enormous emissions" of his vehicles.</p><p>He offered to send her a list of his&nbsp;<a href=#>33 cars</a>&nbsp;- including a Bugatti - if she gave him her email address.</p><p>Greta however responded by taunting Tate, offering up her email address of "smalld**kenergy@getalife.com".</p><p>This seemed to trigger <a href=#>Tate, who then posted an extraordinary rant</a> apparently filmed from his home in <a href=#>Romania</a>, which is a licensed gun range.</p><p>Wearing a red and gold robe and puffing on a cigar, Tate branded Greta a "slave of the matrix" and said she was "programmed".</p><p>He then bizarrely asked for two pizza boxes that were "non-recyclable" which were handed to him.</p><p>It has since been claimed that the <a href=#>pizza box stunt may have led to his arrest</a>.</p><p>The clip featured a stack of boxes from Romanian pizza chain Jerry's Pizza -
