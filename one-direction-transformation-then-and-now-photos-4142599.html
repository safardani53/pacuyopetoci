Their rise to fame <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>was meteoric</a> as they quickly transcended their reality TV fame, and emerged as serious, chart-topping pop stars shortly after the show. They also proved that you don’t have to win to make it big, as the five lads came in third behind runner up <strong>Rebecca Ferguson</strong> and winner <strong>Matt Cardie</strong>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/one-direction-transformation-embed1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-3>The early 2010’s were a non-stop force of One Direction mania as the boys released several smash hits and albums while touring worldwide to millions of screaming fans. Things took a massive turn, however, in 2015 when Zayn decided to leave the group and pursue his own solo opportunities. Despite finishing their tour as a foursome, the boys went on an indefinite hiatus shortly after Zayn’s departure.</p><h2><strong><strong>Harry Styles</strong></strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/harry-styles-one-direction-shutterstock-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-4>Harry’s solo career has taken off in the years since One Direction parted ways, but it seems nobody could have predicted just how quickly his star would rise. Not only did his eponymous debut album and 2019 follow up Fine Line&nbsp;top charts around the world, but he’s made a name for himself as a fashion icon, and a social commentator.&nbsp;Harry has even branched out into acting, and was seen <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>filming&nbsp;</a><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Don’t Worry Darling</a>,&nbsp;directed by his girlfriend <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Olivia Wilde</strong></a>, earlier this year. The couple appeared to make their relationship public after putting on a sweet display of PDA <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>at a wedding</a> for Harry’s agent in Montecito, CA on January 3, 2021. Harry — who officiated the wedding — looked very handsome in a black suit with a velvet bow. In the months since, the couple haven’t been shy about packing on the PDA while enjoying date nights, and cruising around on boats.</p><h2><strong><strong>Liam Payne</strong></strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/liam-payne-then-vs-now-mega-ap-post.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-5><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Liam Payne</strong></a> has continued to release music over the years, but also made headlines for his personal life. He&nbsp;welcomed a son named&nbsp;<strong>Bear&nbsp;</strong>with fellow singer&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Cheryl Cole</strong></a>&nbsp;in 2017. The toddler, who has been kept out of the public eye since his birth, recently celebrated his fourth birthday! In&nbsp;announcing his birth, Liam wrote on Instagram, “I’m incredibly lucky to welcome our new baby boy into the world. It’s a moment that I will never forget for the rest of my life and my favorite memory I have so far.” He later <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>found love</a> with girlfriend <strong>Maya Henry&nbsp;</strong>but their engagement <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>came to an end</a> in 2021. Liam&nbsp;opened up about some of the darker moments in his life during an interview on <strong>Steven Bartlett’</strong>s&nbsp;The Diary of a CEO podcast. During the exchange, Liam recalled a photo of himself partying on a boat, referring to that moment as his “pills and booze phase” amid the height of One Direction’s fame. He also&nbsp;shared, “I’ve just not been very good at relationships. I know what my pattern is with relationships at this point. I’m just not very good at them. I need to work on myself first before I put myself onto somebody else.”</p><h2><strong><strong>Niall Horan</strong></strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/niall-horan-one-direction-shutterstock-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-6>Niall has also made&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>an impact in the music industry</a>. The Irish crooner has embraced his <strong>Ed Sheeran</strong> side on tracks like “Slow Hands” and “This Town” and made his solo Saturday Night Live debut in 2019. In the years since the group disbanded, Niall has offered some insight into the One Direction experience. He reflected on that period of his life during the March 23 episode of&nbsp;<a class=external-link title="(opens new window)" href=# rel="noopener nofollow" aria-describedby=external-disclaimer data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>People, Just People</a>&nbsp;with host&nbsp;<strong>Dermot O’Leary</strong>, comparing the experience to being “a prisoner”. “I struggled with the idea of, ‘Why won’t you just let us out?’” he explained, noting that fans would be “banging on car windows [before we could get out of the vehicle]. [I was thinking], ‘We just want to go for a walk,’ you know?”</p><h2><strong><strong>Louis Tomlinson</strong></strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/louis-tomlinson-one-direction-shutterstock-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-7>Louis not only continued releasing solo music and collaborations with other artists, but he also returned as a judge to where it all began:&nbsp;The X Factor. He was also&nbsp;the first of the One Direction boys to become a father. The singer welcomed an adorable son&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Freddie Reign Tomlinson</strong></a>, with former girlfriend&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Briana Jungwirth</strong></a>&nbsp;in 2016. Louis’ mini-me celebrated his&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>fifth birthday</a>&nbsp;in January 2021, and he’s the&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>spitting image of his dad</a>.&nbsp;The former couple are very protective of their son and&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>rarely share photos</a> of him publicly. Louis opened up about fatherhood in a rare interview with&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Metro</a>&nbsp;in 2019. He explained that Freddie and Briana live in Los Angeles, and Louis splits his time between there and the UK. “I try and spend as much time in England as I do LA and vice versa… to be&nbsp;there to see&nbsp;and go out with Freddie and all of that,” he told the outlet. “Then I have my&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>family in the UK</a>, who I make sure I see plenty of. It’s a bit of a juggle at times but it’s all part of life.”</p><h2><strong><strong>Zayn Malik&nbsp;</strong></strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/zayn-malik-one-direction-shutterstock-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-8>Zayn Malik was the first to depart the band in 2015, and achieved his own success with the song and music video for “Pillowtalk”, which starred his <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>now girlfriend</a> <strong>Gigi Hadid</strong>. Speaking of the international supermodel, the “Vibez” singer <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>welcomed a daughter</a>&nbsp;named&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Khai</strong></a> with Gigi in September 2020. The 28-year-old opened up about fatherhood during a rare&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>interview in March</a>. “Honestly, it’s amazing,” he gushed. “A lot of people that I was speaking to, obviously, before she was born and stuff were like, ‘It’s a big adjustment, and it’s going to be a massive change and stuff.’ But honestly, she’s an amazing baby.” He added, “It’s been really easy for me and Gig to kind of just ease into it. She kind of made it easy for us, she sleeps really well, she loves her milk.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme86nnGacmaeypMDIqKVmrKKWu7SyzqukmqyZpLtuwMeepWaZnpl6r7vWZqehp6SkwG6AkG1pbnFpZA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fone-direction-transformation-then-and-now-photos-4142599.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fone-direction-transformation-then-and-now-photos-4142599.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fone-direction-transformation-then-and-now-photos-4142599.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fone-direction-transformation-then-and-now-photos-4142599.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fone-direction-transformation-then-and-now-photos-4142599.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fone-direction-transformation-then-and-now-photos-4142599.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./who-is-jess-margera-dating.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./who-is-jess-margera-dating.html>Who is Jess Margera Dating Now</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./sister-wives-kody-brown-season-4-episode-5-recap.html>Kody Brown Accused You Became A Polygamist To Get Attention, Say Friends!
