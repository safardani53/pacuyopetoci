Many were then rented out but locals claim nearly 20 have laid empty for up to six years.</p><p>Three were found to have been turned into cannabis farms with squatters also targeting several isolated homes.</p><p>Police raided one in November last year and found 182 marijuana plants in the sprawling house.</p><p>They arrested a 29-year-old man from Merseyside.</p><p>A large white house behind imposing wrought iron gates had also been turned into a cannabis farm this year.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/2023-features-re-abandoned-village-851837038.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/2023-features-re-abandoned-village-851837736.jpg><p>Landowner Edward Cavenagh-Mainwaring, 61, said: "There were cannabis plants up to the ceiling in all the rooms.</p><p>"It was full of marijuana. We didn't see anyone but I guess that's how they operate.</p><p>"In fact they dug trenches to put in electricity cables on my land and used my electricity.</p><p>"We had to ring the electric board as the bill had gone up so much."</p><h2>Lost land</h2><p>Edward, whose family have owned the land for 900 years, lost a quarter of his dairy farm at Whitmore Hall estate through a compulsory purchase order just days before the PM's cancellation announcement.</p><p>He said: “It should have been stopped earlier. A lot of people's lives should have not been upset to the degree they have been.</p><p>"When you walk around the area, it's a bit sad to see it all locked up. You'd never have thought three of these houses would be used as cannabis farms."</p><p>But drug gangs and squatters were not the only unwelcome visitors.</p><p>One security guard, who had been hired to guard a house targeted by squatters, said: "We've had religious cults trying to break in. They would even try to arrest you."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/2023-features-re-abandoned-village-851837882-1.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/2023-features-re-abandoned-village-851837281.jpg><p>Most of the sprawling homes bought by HS2 are on Whitmore Heath where the Slater family have worked at Snape Hall Farm for the last 70 years.</p><p>Dairy farmer John Slater, 38, who runs the farm with his father Chris, 79, said: "It's eerie walking around here.</p><p>"All the houses are empty and padlocked plus we've had sinister-looking security guards walking round.</p><p>"Once HS2 were wrongly told there were going to be protesters in the woods.</p><p>"They sent four or five dog units with their handlers.</p><p>"There weren't any protesters but the dogs barked at the cows and scared them and the guards left the gates open so the animals could get out.</p><p>"It's been a nightmare.

It has all seemed a waste of time and a lot of money."</p><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">Statement from HS2</h3></p><p>An HS2 spokesperson said that many of the properties acquired on Whitmore Heath were purchased under HS2’s discretionary schemes, where homeowner’s ‘opted’ to sell.</p><p>They added: “We understand that people did not choose to live in the path of a high speed railway, and that it can be distressing when land and property is subject to compulsory purchase powers. At all times we endeavour to be understanding and to provide appropriate support and guidance.</p><p>“Where it is financially advantageous for the taxpayer, we always strive to lease properties on the open market, and HS2 Ltd’s agents apply industry standard checks to all prospective tenants. Some properties require maintenance to meet current regulations before being let, and any vacant properties are maintained and kept secure with the interests of local residents in mind.”</p><p>Of the properties they currently own in the area, six were being refurbished and five were on the market for rental.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>They added that no squatters have been evicted from HS2 properties and the sole eviction, in Whitmore Heath, saw “the removal of people given access to a property by its then tenant.&nbsp; HS2 Ltd absolutely condemns any illegal activity taking place in property it manages. We work with the police and other authorities to prevent or stop it if and where it occurs.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqecsKtfZ4F0hY9vb3FnkZeur7DOp5ydZaaeua2txp5koatiYrCius2amaKrXZuus7nSZq6hoaSivLOxjg%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fabandoned-village-hs2-cannabis-farms-whitmore.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fabandoned-village-hs2-cannabis-farms-whitmore.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fabandoned-village-hs2-cannabis-farms-whitmore.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fabandoned-village-hs2-cannabis-farms-whitmore.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fabandoned-village-hs2-cannabis-farms-whitmore.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fabandoned-village-hs2-cannabis-farms-whitmore.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./becca-bowen-just-be-you-music-video.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./becca-bowen-just-be-you-music-video.html>Becca Bowen Shares Just Be You Music Video For Self-Love Anthem Hollywood Life</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./tdpresentss-girlfriend-list.html>TDPresentss Girlfriend: Who is TDPresents Dating?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./tdpresentss-girlfriend-list.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
