Prior to their <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>divorce drama</a>, the Salty K founder often shared photos of Kroy via Instagram to gush over her leading man.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>In Apr. 2021, Kim shared <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>a selfie</a> with Kroy to gush over their recent family trip. “Mom & Dad!! Friday we let the kids ‘skip’ school @kroybiermann in the past would never go for that lol but a lot has changed since Ethan passed,” her sweet caption began. “So we headed to Columbia SC to see a friend of mine with @briellebiermann @zachbaus @hartahumada We went to Frankies’s (rode go carts, bumper boats, played games and had a blast) had an amazing dinner then the ‘littles’ went to bed and we had wine w/ everyone way past 2am it was such an awesome little get away! Ethan taught us A LOT but one of the biggest blessings from him is to really start living Time waits for no one.
