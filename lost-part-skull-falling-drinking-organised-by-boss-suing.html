alcohol-fuelled bash in <a href=#>Reading</a>, Berks., in 2019.</p><p>He claimed he and his colleagues were told to down beers in as few mouthfuls as possible before being ranked by their superiors as part of a "pub golf" game.</p><p>Their scores were recorded on cards before being distributed in the office, according to Michael's High Court claim.</p><p>The employees visited nine bars and pubs in the town - referred to as "holes" - after allegedly being badgered to attend by department manager Simon Fradgley.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read more on UK news">Read

became so intoxicated that he has no memory of the rest of the outing past 10pm - before he was found lying in the street with a serious head injury after falling over.</p><p>He told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">ITV</a> last year: "Doctors and the police came to the conclusion that I fell over and didn’t use my hands to break the fall so I ended up hitting my head on the floor.</p><p>"The next thing I remember was four weeks later."</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in The Sun</h2></p><p>The 28-year-old had to have part of his skull removed by doctors and spent six months recovering from his horror accident.</p><p>Doctors dubbed him a "walking miracle", although it is claimed he still suffers from "persistent cognitive symptoms".</p><p>Michael returned to work part-time in October 2019, while PwC cancelled their annual event that had ran for around seven years.</p><p>According to his LinkedIn page, the auditor was promoted to a managerial role at the Reading office in January this year.</p><p>In his claim to the High Court, Michael's solicitors say PwC should be held liable for the negligence of Simon Fradgley.</p><p>They accuse him of "failing to take reasonable care for the safety of co-workers" and pressuring people into attending the event.</p><p>Company chiefs allegedly "encouraged excessive consumption of alcohol", with Michael claiming the same occurred at a similar event the year before.</p><p>He is now suing PwC, where he is still employed, for more than £200,000 and is requesting that additional future payments be made available.</p><p>Court documents claim there is a risk that the worker could develop epilepsy in the long-term as a result of his extensive injuries.</p><p>A spokesman for PwC said: "We are unable to comment on the specifics of a matter that is subject to ongoing legal proceedings.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN
