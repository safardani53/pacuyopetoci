The reboot of the 90s franchise has been in development hell for years, but all seemed hopeful when <strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Jason Momoa</a> </strong>and director <strong>Corin Hardy </strong>were attached to the project. However, both have flown the coop, leaving the Crow reboot’s fate a mystery.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>For those unaware, every one of The Crow movies is based on a similar theme: someone is usually murdered in a cruel way. Then, a mystical crow resurrects them while granting this new revenant magical powers to aid in their quest for justice. There is often a romantic element to the story – avenging lover, etc. – which adds even more of a tragic element to the story. In the films, the character of The Crow has always been a male, but in both the comics and the television show, The Crow: Stairway to Heaven, there have been female Crows.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/the-crow-embed1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-4>The Crow first arrived not on the big screen, but on the comic bookshelves, in 1989. The first issue of <strong>James O’Barr’s</strong>&nbsp;dark underground comic was adapted to the big screen by writers <strong>David J. Schow </strong>and <strong>John Shirley</strong>&nbsp;and directed by <strong>Alex Proyas</strong>. A young <strong>Brandon Lee </strong>was cast in the lead role of Eric Draven/The Crow. Sadly, an on-set accident with a handgun resulted in <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Brandon’s death</a>, casting a grim shadow over the movie. The Crow was a sleeper hit at the box office, grossing $94 million worldwide. The film and its soundtrack – featuring <strong>The Cure, Stone Temple Pilots, Nine Inch Nails, Rollins Band, Helmet, </strong>and <strong>My Life with the Thrill Kill Kult </strong>– had a profound effect on alternative/goth culture.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>The second film, The Crow: City of Angels, arrived in 1996. Directed by <strong>Tim Pope</strong>, City of Angels cast <strong>Vincent Pérez </strong>as Ashe Corven/The Crow and featured <strong>Iggy Pop </strong>and <strong>Deftones </strong>(as themselves.) It was less successful than the first, pulling $17.9 million domestic (on a reported $13 million budget) per <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Box Office Mojo</a>. Despite these diminishing returns, a third movie – The Crow: Salvation – was released in 2000. This direct-to-video sequel has <strong>Eric Maibus </strong>as Alex Corvis/The Crow, and it features <strong>Kirsten Dunst</strong> as Erin Randall. It was met with a poor reception and a minimal theatrical run. The same can be said for the fourth (and currently, the last?) Crow film, 2005’s The Crow: Wicked Prayer. This time around, <strong>Edward Furlong</strong> is Jimmy Cuervo/The Crow. It also featured <strong>Tara Reid</strong>, <strong>Dennis Hopper</strong>, <strong>Danny Trejo</strong>, and <strong>David Boreanaz. </strong>Again, it was a poorly received project.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/the-crow-embed2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-6>Yet, like the titular superhero, The Crow doesn’t stay dead. So, here’s what you need to know about The Crow Reborn.</p><h3><span><span><b><i><strong>Who Was Involved in the Project?</strong></i></b></span></span></h3><p id=content-paragraph-7>In 2009, producer <strong>Ryan Kavanaugh </strong>announced that his company, Relativity Media, was in negotiations for the rights to The Crow for a reboot, per <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Gizmodo</a>. <strong>Steve Norrington</strong>, who directed Blade and The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, was first attached to the project, but he left in 2011. 28 Weeks Later director <strong>Juan Carlos Fresnadillo </strong>replaced him but left in the project a few months later, per <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Screen Rant</a><strong>. F. Javier Gutiérrez </strong>was tapped to take over, but he left in 2014. Corin Hardy stepped in and was with the project until leaving in 2018.</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>Similarly, the leading role became a game of “Hot Potato,” passing from one man to another. Jason Momoa seemingly had it last because, in November 2021, test footage of him in The Crow makeup leaked to the internet. Gone was Momoa’s trademark beard, and he sported the iconic white face with black eye paint.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Apparently people are frothing over some still pics of Jason Momoa’s THE CROW test footage. So here’s some of the actual footage. Hope they get the chance to revisit this one day. <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>#TheCrow</a> <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>pic.twitter.com/xGcQTdhHKG</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-9>— Ryan (Dressed like a Cool Youth Pastor) (@itsRyanUnicomb) <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>November 26, 2021</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-11>“I’ve waited 8 years to play this dream role. I love you @corinhardy and @sonypictures unfortunately I may have to wait 8 more. Not our team,” Jason wrote in 2018 when he exited the project. “But I swear I will. James O’Barr [creator of the comic book series The Crow] sorry to let you down I won’t on the next. This film needs to be set free. And to the fans. Sorry. I can’t play anything but what this film deserves and it needs love. I’m ready when it’s right.”</p><h3><span><span><b><i><strong>Why Was It Cancelled?</strong></i></b></span></span></h3><p id=content-paragraph-14>In 2015, The Crow reboot stalled because Relativity declared bankruptcy, per <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The Hollywood Reporter</a>. The following year, <strong>Samuel Hadida’s</strong>&nbsp;Davis Films, Highland Film Group, and Electric Shadow acquired the rights to The Crow, per <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>THR</a>,&nbsp;and a year later, Sony came on to distribute the film. However, financial issues between Samuel Hadida and Sony were credited to The Crow Reborn’s&nbsp;stalling and ultimate demise. The project last had an Oct. 11, 2019 release date.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/the-crow-embed3.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-15><strong>&nbsp;</strong>While Jason Momoa was the last person cast, he was not the first. <strong>Bradley Cooper, Mark Wahlberg, Channing Tatum, Ryan Gosling, James McAvoy, Tom Hiddleston, Alexander Skarsgard, Luke Evans, Sam Witwer, Jack Huston</strong>, <strong>Nicholas Hoult, </strong>and <strong>JackO’Connelll </strong>have been linked to the project, with some – Luke Evans, Bradley Cooper – either signing on or in talks to play the new Eric Draven, while others were merely rumored to play the part.</p><p id=content-paragraph-16>“I do think both James O’Barr’s original Crow graphic novel and the subsequent other iterations of that character in the comic books, there’s no reason not to do a lot more with that character, the concept of The Crow, the mythology of The Crow, and the tone and what that represents is still unique within the world we’re in at the moment,” he added.</p><p id=content-paragraph-17><strong>—-</strong></p><p id=content-paragraph-18>If The Crow movies are about anything, it’s that death is not the end. Nearly thirty years after the first movie, The Crow remains a cult classic whose influence can be felt to this very day. One day, the cinematic world might again hear the beating of crow’s wings. Until then, keep listening.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme9OhnGaboqTEbr7Em6arpl1pg3GCk3JsaA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fthe-crow-reborn-4606495.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fthe-crow-reborn-4606495.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fthe-crow-reborn-4606495.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fthe-crow-reborn-4606495.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fthe-crow-reborn-4606495.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fthe-crow-reborn-4606495.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./kimbella-matos-19960415-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./kimbella-matos-19960415-html.html>Kimbella Matos (Instagram Star) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./celebs-wearing-lace-dresses-pics-photos.html>Celebs Wearing Lace Dresses Pics Of Stars In The Look Hollywood Life</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./celebs-wearing-lace-dresses-pics-photos.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
