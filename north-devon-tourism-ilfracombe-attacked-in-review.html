Gluten intolerance or lactose, if it’s trendy to have… they have it.</p><p>"They post on all forms of social media about their wonderful life with photos of them basically naked, or selfies by the ocean or parents backyard.</p><p>"Then tweet about how they suffer from anxiety and depression the next.</p><p>"They sneer at men working the harbour, complain everyone is racist when they haven’t even left the confides of mummy and daddy’s white suburb and are generally awful people to be close to in Wetherspoons – even though they claim to friends they avoid Wetherspoons."</p><p>And don't get the raging reviewer started on tourists.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in The Sun</h2></p><p>He or she ends their rant by saying the "true nemesis" of Ilfracombe is "entitled teens from London" arriving on holiday.</p><p>"They truly know how to become a victim of food allergies and hogging social media posts away from Ilfracombe’s own brats," they added.</p><p>"With actual good looks and real wealth flaunted on a private yacht.</p><p>"Rather than the Ilfracombe girl posing on the Ilfracombe princess tour, claiming she’s on a friend’s yacht.</p><p>They sign off with a particularly bitter comment: "Thank you London girls, we owe you our gratitude."</p><h2>LOCALS HIT BACK</h2><p>Residents and business owners in the picturesque Victorian town have told the Sun the comments are a travesty.</p><p>Paul Swailes, the former assistant head-teacher at Ilfracombe Academy and now co-owner of The Pier art gallery, said: "That’s way off-beam.</p><p>‘"I taught here for 30 years and I don’t recognise it as a description of either the students or their parents."</p><p>"The idea that they’re&nbsp;snooty&nbsp;is absurd," the 64-year-old added.</p><p>County councillor for Ilfracombe, Paul Crabb, said the ILiveHere critic was "spectacularly wrong".</p><p>"He seems to think the snack of choice among young people in Ilfracombe is tofu and quinoa," said Mr Crabb.</p><p>"There’s nothing wrong with that.&nbsp; But it suggests to me that he or she does not live here.</p><p>"It’s complete tosh. As for being&nbsp;snooty&nbsp;or snobbish, there’s a reason why thousands of visitors come to Ilfracombe every year and why so many want to move here.</p><p>"It’s because we’re a friendly, welcoming place."</p><p>Tara O’ Callaghan, owner of Take Thyme fish restaurant, labelled the town a "fabulous community."</p><p>‘There are people with money but there are others with literally nothing,’ the 49-year-old said.</p><p>"They all get along fine. It’s very diverse.</p><p>"To tar an entire age group as snobs is ridiculous anyway."</p><p>And Emma Rice, 46, who works for Tara, said it was damaging to portray Ilfracombe as&nbsp;snooty.</p><p>She explained shop owners such as themselves rely on tourism to support their business.</p><p>"People love it here. You’d be surprised how many visitors sit in our restaurant going through local property for sale, seeking somewhere they can afford," she added.</p><p>Another devoted resident emphasised the same points and urged potential holidaymakers their town was naturally friendly.</p><p>Emma Scott, a 46-year-old carer, said: "In 15 years I’ve never felt people were judging me or behaving snobbishly.</p><p>"It’s just not like that."</p><p>And a trawlerman, who asked not to be named, actually laughed out loud when informed of the middle-class jibe.</p><p>The biggest problem I believe Ilfracombe has, is its whole generation of 16-24 year olds raised by middle class parents."</p><span class=quote-credit>Anonymous review</span><span class=quote-credit-meta>ILiveHere</span><p>"I live in Barnstaple," he said. "Most of us think of Ilfracombe as a bit rough."</p><p>A local builder, Ed Greenwood agreed and said he was shocked by the anonymous scathing review.</p><p>Much loved landlord, John Quinn, at the 14th century George and Dragon Inn also refuted the claims.</p><p>He said: "Neither the young people I employ, nor their parents, act in the way they’re portrayed.</p><p>"We have asylum seekers currently staying at an Ilfracombe hotel and I’ve watched local kids playing football with them on the promenade. They all get along fine.</p><p>"Many local people have also been very kind in the way they’ve dropped off food and clothes for them."</p><p>But Ilfracombe is not the only town that earned a name for itself in online reviews.</p><p>According <a aria-label="The Daily Mail (opens in a new tab)" href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">MailOnline</a>, Harpenden in <a href=#>Hertfordshire</a>, Harrogate in <a href=#>Yorkshire </a>and Leigh-on-Sea in <a href=#>Essex</a>, have all been dragged through the mud for their perceived 'snobbiness.'</p><p>This comes as residents in the <a href=#>"UK's snootiest town" </a>are outrages as rich newcomers push them out.</p><p>Morpeth in&nbsp;<a href=#>Northumberland</a>&nbsp;was recently voted one of the UK's snootiest towns according to the same review site ILiveHere.</p><p>The historic Northumberland suburb, which is 15 miles north of Newcastle, lies on the River Wansbeck.&nbsp;</p><p>But in this instance locals actually agree with the review.</p><p>One local, who works in the town, said: "The accolade doesn't surprise me. People are snobby here.</p><p>"I sell affordable goods and they turn their nose up and question why they're so cheap."</p><p>Another woman, 43, who did not want to be named, has lived in the town her entire life.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>She said: "The posh people who move here are snooty.</p><p>"The new builds have pushed the locals out."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/ilfracombe-north-devon-labelled-snobbish-792701025.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/ilfracombe-north-devon-labelled-snobbish-792701037.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/ilfracombe-north-devon-labelled-snobbish-792700897.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/ilfracombe-north-devon-labelled-snobbish-792700913.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqecsKtfZ350fpZvaG9nnqS%2FtbSMnZyvp55iwbDB0aKqpmWZobOzrcKopJudXZbBta3CpJydZZmjerOx1aKcsGc%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fnorth-devon-tourism-ilfracombe-attacked-in-review.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fnorth-devon-tourism-ilfracombe-attacked-in-review.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fnorth-devon-tourism-ilfracombe-attacked-in-review.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fnorth-devon-tourism-ilfracombe-attacked-in-review.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fnorth-devon-tourism-ilfracombe-attacked-in-review.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fnorth-devon-tourism-ilfracombe-attacked-in-review.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./patrick-haggerty-a-lead-singer-of-lavender-country-passed-away-at-the-age-of-78.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./patrick-haggerty-a-lead-singer-of-lavender-country-passed-away-at-the-age-of-78.html>Patrick Haggerty A Lead Singer Of Lavender Country Passed Away At The Age Of 78</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./mike-batayeh-health-issue-how-did-he-die-weight-loss-before-death.html>Mike Batayeh Health Issue: How Did He Die?
