Here's what we know about David and what the rumors suggest.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Who is 'RHONY's Sai De Silva's husband?</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>Sai is married to a man named David Craig. The two have been <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">married for over 14 years,</a> with their wedding ceremony taking place back in 2009. There isn't a lot of public information about David, and he does not seem to have any public social media accounts. Sai addressed his privacy <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">on her blog</a>.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>She wrote, "He likes his privacy. In a world where we share everything, it’s nice to have something that is private in my life. It keeps my sanity and I also think having a little mystery is fun. However, he is very involved when it comes to his family and I think he should win an award for father of the year!"</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Sai De Silva's husband once owned a bar where she bartended at.</h2><p>During Season 14, Episode 11, Sai recollected back to her bartending days, which reportedly took place at Swim Bar, an establishment owned by her now-husband, per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Collider</a>. Rumor has it Sai "took" her husband from his now-ex-wife and "got knocked up." Of course, none of this information has been confirmed but it certainly has many wondering if Sai had any right pressuring Jessel to be genuine and commenting on her husband's trip to Vietnam.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Does Sai De Silva have any kids?</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Sai is the proud mother of two kids, one daughter (London) and one son (Rio).</p><p>While she doesn't share photos of Rio on her social media frequently, the reality TV star constantly shares photos of herself and her daughter in stunning looks. Safe to say, London is taking after her mother and is pursuing a role in the fashion world at a young age.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Sai De Silva also has a successful digital brand.</h2><p>Outside of RHONY, Sai is known for her digital brand called Scout The City. The name of her company was actually inspired by her daughter, and first born, London.</p><p>She said in an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Wrap</a>, "Her middle name is Scout and that came from To Kill a Mockingbird. And that’s how my whole entire brand started, was through when she was born."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Sai went on to say that the show is a great way for people to know more about her outside of her brand: "I think I’m really excited for people to just get to know me a little bit more. Because I do this for a living, this online personality, it is a very curated lifestyle that I have. It’s very surface-level. I think on the show, you’re really going to see a more vulnerable me."</p><p>Scout The City is the name of both her very successful YouTube channel and the name of her blog that gives her fans insight into everything from fashion to fitness. She serves as both <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the founder and the creative director </a>of the brand.</p><p>Viewers of her debut season will get more insight into Sai's private life while showcasing some of her amazing outfits along the way.
