<time>13 Jul 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p><strong>PAYING for sex used to be thought of as something only men would do, but it is more and more likely to be a woman handing over the cash.</strong></p><p>New films How To Please A Woman – where a male cleaning company offers “extras” on the side – and <a href=#>Good Luck To You, Leo Grande</a> – which sees <a href=#>Emma Thompson</a> play a widow hiring an escort – are bang on trend, as male escort services are booming.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/NINTCHDBPICT000745525527.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/NINTCHDBPICT000745315248-2.jpg><p>As more women book encounters to satisfy their desires, Ross*, a 36-year-old <a href=#>escort</a> in London, reveals what his job entails . . .</p><h2 class=has-text-align-center>MONDAY: TWO BOOKINGS</h2><p>IT might be the start of another working week for everyone else, but Mondays tend to be quiet for me.</p><p>I don’t think you’d pick me out as the male escort in a room. People think I’d be super buff and tanned, but I’d probably give myself 7/10.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE ON MALE ESCORTS">READ MORE ON MALE ESCORTS</h2><p>I’m no Magic Mike, but I work out, look approachable and friendly — and women seem to like that.</p><p>It helps that I’m brilliant in bed, too.</p><p>I get most of my work through an agency — and today I receive two bookings for later in the week.</p><p>I pay a monthly fee to put my details on the agency site. I won’t show my face online but will provide full frontal pictures for clients on request.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in News</h2></p><p>I don’t want to be recognised online as who knows what I’ll end up doing in the future.</p><p>I’m an actor by profession, but it’s never really taken off for me.</p><h2 class=has-text-align-center>TUESDAY: MISSIONARY POSITION WITH KATY</h2><p>I CHARGE £150 an hour for in-person bookings, or £1 a minute for video dates on Zoom or WhatsApp.</p><p>I average two or three face-to- face jobs a week.</p><p>Tonight I’m seeing Katy, a regular, which is nice as I already know what she likes.</p><p>Clients rarely tell me their ages but I’d guess Katy is late forties.</p><p>Most of my clients are around that age, rarely younger, although one was in her twenties and the oldest in her sixties.</p><p>Tonight’s meet will be in a central London hotel. I dress to look smart and professional.</p><p>Sometimes I’ll get requests for specific outfits, like a navy suit or a fitted white T-shirt, but I’ve never had anything seedy.</p><p>You’d be surprised how “normal” most women want the encounter to be.</p><p>When it comes to undies I stick to classic tight briefs, which I’ve never had any complaints about.</p><p>I usually take a couple of props with me too, like a vibrator, some ties, oils and lubrication.</p><p>A massage is a good way to start touching if the woman is nervous, which first-timers often are.</p><p>Katy and I chat, then we have sex, very slowly, in the missionary position, her request. I always use a condom.</p><h2 class=has-text-align-center>WEDNESDAY: I WORRY ABOUT CLIENTS FALLING FOR ME</h2><p>I GOT into escorting by accident when talking to a trainer at my gym in 2018.</p><p>He told me he did it to top up earnings and then how much he made, which was far more than I did at my part-time, zero-hours gig.</p><p>I’m straight and love sex with women so decided to give it a go, as it meant I could still get to my acting auditions, too.</p><p>My first job was a lady around 50 who wanted me to use my hands to bring her to orgasm.</p><p>I was terrified but she seemed happy.</p><p>Luckily I’ve been single the whole time.</p><p>I don’t think a girlfriend would accept me doing this.</p><p>My biggest worry is clients developing unwanted feelings for me and confusing our encounters for a real relationship.</p><p>It has happened and if it escalates now I’ll just block them.</p><p>I genuinely like a lot of my clients, but there’s no love involved.</p><h2 class=has-text-align-center>THURSDAY: WATCHING MARIE ENGAGE IN SOLO PLAY</h2><p>THIS afternoon I saw Marie.</p><p>I was her 57th birthday present to herself.</p><p>The biggest difference with older women is that most are incredibly direct.</p><p>Marie wanted me to watch her solo play then join in.</p><p>I have one regular who likes me to spank her and another likes sex by windows.</p><p>Other clients just want to lie back and do nothing.</p><p>There’s also the women who don’t know what they want or have lost confidence after a break-up and I help them find their mojo again.</p><p>I find those jobs really satisfying — not giving up until she gets there and seeing a woman completely losing control.</p><p>Then I get paid for it. That’s good for the ego.</p><h2 class=has-text-align-center>FRIDAY: DINNER WITH ANNABEL</h2><p>SOME women just want my company.</p><p>One Friday a month I’ll see Annabel, who is probably only ten years older than me.</p><p>She’s lonely and wealthy and it’s about the “boyfriend” experience for her.</p><p>We always go for dinner at the big-name restaurant she used to go to with her ex-husband.</p><p>She gets dressed up, we have champagne and flirt.</p><p>At the end I kiss her goodbye on the cheek.</p><p>But nothing sexual ever happens.</p><h2 class=has-text-align-center>SATURDAY: RE-ENACTING PORN WITH LISA</h2><p>LUNCH out with my family before a job tonight.</p><p>Although it’s all legal, my parents have no idea what I do.</p><p>Tonight’s new client, Lisa, is too busy to date and wants no-hassle fun.</p><p>She is sick of men on apps sending d**k pics. I hear that a lot.</p><p>We order room service and watch some porn then copy it.</p><h2 class=has-text-align-center>SUNDAY: REST DAY</h2><p>NO bookings today. I might be single but the main thing I’ve learnt about women from escorting is how important it is to listen to them.</p><p>Sex isn’t everything, even when someone is paying for it.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The Sun">Read More on The Sun</h2><p>So many times I come away from an appointment feeling more like a therapist than an escort.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>Maybe that’s what I’ll end up doing next.</p><p><strong>*Name has been changed.</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqecsKtfZoZyf5hsaWlnnZa5pnnErJqoqqRiwKav0Z6rrGWcpLumuNhmrqillaN8</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fmale-escort-secrets-lonely-women.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fmale-escort-secrets-lonely-women.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fmale-escort-secrets-lonely-women.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fmale-escort-secrets-lonely-women.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fmale-escort-secrets-lonely-women.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fmale-escort-secrets-lonely-women.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./paul-saladino-cp4t-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./paul-saladino-cp4t-html.html>Paul Saladino (TikTok Star) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./jenelle-evans-husband-david-eason-confederate-flag-picture.html>Former MTV Star David Eason Wears Confederate Flag</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./jenelle-evans-husband-david-eason-confederate-flag-picture.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
