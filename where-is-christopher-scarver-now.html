The man who killed serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer is a poet and an artist — now he'll appear in Netflix's 'DAHMER.'</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: CNN</a></figure><p>Many movies and TV shows have covered serial killer <a href=#><u>Jeffrey Dahmer</u></a>’s life — including <a href=#>Netflix</a> limited series DAHMER - Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story, starring <a href=#>Evan Peters</a> as the killer. But the man who killed Dahmer, <a href=#>Christopher Scarver</a>, doesn’t land in the spotlight as much. So, where is Christopher Scarver now?</p><p>In both DAHMER and the upcoming Netflix season of <a href=#>Conversations With a Killer</a>, we'll watch and listen as Dahmer's heinous acts unfold before the public. Previous seasons of Conversations profiled <a href=#>John Wayne Gacy</a> and <a href=#>Ted Bundy</a>, so it's only fitting to add Dahmer to the list, especially as a complement to the <a href=#>Ryan Murphy/Ian Brennan</a>-produced reenactment series.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: CNN</a><p>Jeffrey Dahmer</p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Christopher Scarver is now known as Jeffrey Dahmer's killer.</h2><p>Scarver last made headlines in 2015 when he spoke to the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>New York Post</u></a> about killing Dahmer. They were both sent to Columbia Correctional Institution, where he would taunt other inmates by fashioning severed limbs out of prison food, according to Scarver. “He crossed the line with some people — prisoners, prison staff,” Scarver told the Post. “Some people who are in prison are repentant — but he was not one of them.”</p><p>After Dahmer was arrested in 1991, he confessed to killing 17 boys and men over a murder spree lasting longer than a decade. The following year, a jury found him sane and guilty of 15 murders, and he was sentenced to 15 consecutive life sentences, according to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>History.com</u></a>.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"></figure><p>On Nov. 28, 1994, Dahmer, Scarver, and a third inmate named Jesse Anderson were instructed to clean the gymnasium bathrooms at the prison. With a newspaper clipping about Dahmer’s murders in his pocket, Scarver grabbed a metal bar from the weight room of the gym and confronted Dahmer, as he told the Post. “I asked him if he did those things ’cause I was fiercely disgusted,” he recalled. “He was shocked. Yes, he was. He started looking for the door pretty quick. I blocked him.”</p><p>Scarver then struck Dahmer with the bar, crushing his skull. “He ended up dead,” Scarver told the newspaper. “I put his head down.”</p><p>Then, Scarver killed Anderson — who was serving a life sentence for the 1992 killing of his wife. He pleaded no contest to the murders and was sentenced to an additional two life sentences.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Scarver was first sentenced to life in prison for a 1990 murder.</h2><p>According to the Post, Scarver was sentenced to life in prison for the killing of Steven Lohman, a worker at Wisconsin Conservation Corps, in 1990. After getting fired from a job-training program with the corps, Scarver started drinking and hearing voices that called him “the chosen one,” as the newspaper reported.</p><p>Scarver then returned to the workplace with a pistol and demanded money from a site manager. When the site manager gave him only $15, Scarver shot Lohman three times.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"></figure><p>He was sentenced to life in prison and sent to Columbia Correctional Institution in Portage, Wis. However, in 2003, Scarver was moved to the Centennial Correctional Facility in Colorado, according to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Telegraph-Herald</a> after "Judge Barbara Crabb ordered the state to transfer Scarver and three dozen other mentally ill inmates from the prison in 2001 in response to a class-action lawsuit filed by the inmates."</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Now, Scarver writes poetry and books while serving out his life sentences.</h2><p>Scarver is still in prison serving multiple life sentences, but now, he self-publishes poetry. He appears to have <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>refuted many details in the</u> <u>Post</u><u> story</u></a> and has been spending his free time “writing songs, music compositions, short stories, poetry, and prison policy proposals, as well as creating original art,” according to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>an Amazon bio</u></a>.</p><p>Scarver also wishes to attend college for mechanical and electrical engineering through his American Prisoner Repatriation Act (APRA) initiative, the Amazon blurb states. In fact, as of 2012, he was even shopping around a tell-all book about killing Dahmer. According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TMZ</a>, the book would reveal the "sick, sadistic mind games and practical jokes" Dahmer played on everyone around him in the prison.</p><p>He also has multiple poetry books for sale, including 2015’s The Child Left Behind.</p><p>In DAHMER, Scarver will be portrayed by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Furly Mac</a>. Some might recognize the up-and-coming actor as the Elevator Attendant in The United States vs. Billie Holiday or as Mike Mike in Star. His first project with Ryan Murphy could be the beginning of a long collaboration and career for Furly.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWmvsRmoKxlk52%2Fqr%2FTqKehnaJiwKSt0a%2Bcq2WepMQ%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhere-is-christopher-scarver-now.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwhere-is-christopher-scarver-now.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwhere-is-christopher-scarver-now.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwhere-is-christopher-scarver-now.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhere-is-christopher-scarver-now.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhere-is-christopher-scarver-now.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./jigee-viertel.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./jigee-viertel.html>Jigee Viertel</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./cassie-bikini-alex-fine-anniversary-trip-daughter-frankie-photo.html>Cassie Wears Bikini &amp;amp; Holds Daughter While Celebrating Anniversary Hollywood Life</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./cassie-bikini-alex-fine-anniversary-trip-daughter-frankie-photo.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
