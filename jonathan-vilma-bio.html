Instead, he was a born leader who led his team through highs and lows.</p><p>As a result, the 41-year-old is regarded by many as one of the best linebackers of his generation.</p><p>Additionally, Jonathan is now one of the best young football analysts in the country following his retirement from football.</p><p>Having said this, you guys might be wondering what his early life looked like or what he achieved during his career.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Jonathan-Vilma-300x198.jpg><p>Well, don’t worry as we have got you covered because not only have we got information about his early life and career, but we also have intel on his net worth, salary, age, nationality, wife, kids, family, and social media.</p><p>So without further ado, let’s get started.</p><h2>Quick Facts</h2><table class=mytable width=795><tbody readability=7.2254004576659><tr><td><strong>Full Name</strong></td><td>Jonathan Polynice Vilma</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Birth Date</strong></td><td>April 16, 1982</td></tr><tr readability=4><td><strong>Birth Place</strong></td><td>Coral Gables, Florida, U.S.A</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Nick Name</strong></td><td>Not available</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Religion</strong></td><td>Not available</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Nationality</strong></td><td>American</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Ethnicity</strong></td><td>Not available</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Education</strong></td><td>University of Miami</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Horoscope</strong></td><td>Aries</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Father’s Name</strong></td><td>Fritz Vilma</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Mother’s Name</strong></td><td>Nelly Vilma</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Siblings</strong></td><td>Alice Vilma</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Age</strong></td><td>41 Years Old</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Height</strong></td><td>6’1″ (1.85 m)</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Weight</strong></td><td>104 kg (230 lbs)</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Shoe Size</strong></td><td>Not available</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Hair Color</strong></td><td>Black</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Eye Color</strong></td><td>Black</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Body Measurement</strong></td><td>Not available</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Build</strong></td><td>Muscular</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Married</strong></td><td>No</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Girlfriends</strong></td><td>No</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Spouse</strong></td><td>No</td></tr><tr readability=3><td><strong>Profession&nbsp;</strong></td><td>Sports Journalism (Current), National Football League (Retired)</td></tr><tr readability=3><td><strong>Position</strong></td><td>Football Analyst (Current), Linebacker (NFL)</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Net Worth</strong></td><td>$21 million</td></tr><tr readability=3><td><strong>Clubs&nbsp;</strong></td><td>New Orleans Saints (2008-2013), New York Jets (2004-2007)</td></tr><tr readability=2><td><strong>Broadcasting Affiliations</strong></td><td>ESPN</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Social Media</strong></td><td><a href=#>Instagram</a>, <a href=# rel=noopener>Facebook</a></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Shoes</strong></td><td>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Merch</strong></td><td><a href=# rel="sponsored noopener">Jersey</a>, <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener">Autograph</a></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Last Update</strong></td><td>November, 2023</td></tr></tbody></table><h2>Jonathan Vilma: Early Life & Family</h2><p>Starting, Jonathan Polynice Vilma was born to his parents, Fritz Vilma and Nelly Vilma, on April 16, 1982, in Coral Gables, Florida.</p><p>Furthermore, Jonathan’s parents were originally from Haiti before immigrating to the U.S. Besides, the Florida native has a sister, Alice Vilma, with whom he grew up.</p><p>But, despite hours of searching, we still could not find any details regarding his childhood.</p><p>But, we did find out that he attended the G.W. Carver Middle School and then Coral Gables High School, where he earned a name for himself playing for his high school football team.</p><p>After that, Vilma enrolled at the University of Miami after receiving a scholarship at the University of Miami.</p><p>Subsequently, the Florida native played for the Miami Hurricanes football team from 2000 to 2003, impressing many NFL scouts on the way.</p><p>In fact, by the time he finished his four-year stint, Vilma was a three-time Academic All-Big East Conference.</p><p>Thus, at the end of 2003, Jonathan graduated from the University of Miami with a finance degree from the School of Business Administration.</p><h2>Jonathan Vilma: Career & Stats</h2><p>Jonathan started his professional career with the New York Jets when they selected him 12th overall in the 2004 NFL Draft. Having been one of the top picks, expectations were high for the Florida native to perform.</p><p>Subsequently, he rose to the expectations as he won the NFL Defensive Rookie of the Year. Besides, Vilma finished the campaign with 107 tackles, three interceptions, and two sacks.</p><p>Thus, having just had a great year, the pressure was on Jonathan to perform even better during his second season in the NFL.</p><p>And that is precisely what the 41-year-old did as he led the NFL in tackles with 169. Furthermore, Vilma also made his first appearance at Pro Bowl in 2006.</p><p>Thereafter, the Florida native had another commendable season with the Jets compiling stats of 114 tackles, one fumble recovery, a forced fumble, and an interception.</p><p>However, Vilma’s fourth year with the franchise turned out to be a nightmare. The reason being, he suffered a season-ending knee injury in the week seven game against the Cincinnati Bengals.</p><p>Thus, a combination of injury and short duration left in the contract led the Jets to trade the 6 feet 1 linebacker to the New Orleans Saints for a fourth-round draft pick in the 2008 NFL Draft and another 2009 NFL Draft.</p><h3>New Orleans Saints</h3><p>Having just been traded to the Saints, everyone expected Jonathan to take time to adapt. However, he did the opposite as he was the only positive in a weak defensive unit, which conceded many touchdowns.</p><p>Nonetheless, the 41-year-old ended his first season with the saints with 132 tackles and one sack in 16 games.</p><p>Moving on, the following year, no one would have expected the New Orleans Saints to reach the Super Bowl, let alone win it.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Vilma-Playing-for-New-Orleans-Saints-300x169.jpg><p>But that is what happened as Vilma led his team to the Super Bowl XLIV after making some vital plays that helped them beat the Indianapolis Colts 31-17.</p><p>Added to that, Jonathan was also selected for his second Pro Bowl appearance.</p><p>After that, Vilma had a pretty good 2010 season, where he led the team in tackles, and then had a disastrous 2011 due to a knee injury.</p><p>However, no one predicted the storm that New Orleans Saints and Vilma would have to face in the 2012 season.</p><p><strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Eben Britton Bio: Net Worth, Hotboxin, Wife, Height, Salary Wiki >></a></strong></p><p>During the 2012 season, the Saints got involved in a scandal that alleged that defensive coordinator Gregg Williams offered his players cash for taking out opposition players.</p><p>Likewise, Vilma was also alleged to have offered his teammates $10,000 to take out Brett Favre in the 2009 NFC Championship Game.</p><p>As a consequence, Jonathan got suspended for the entirety of the 2012 season. But that was nothing compared to the massive hit his hard-earned years of reputation suffered.</p><p>Added to that, fans and pundits alike started calling the player and the organization a cheat.</p><p>Thus, we believe that Vilma never really recovered from that incident because after having an injury-ridden 2013 season, he officially retired from NFL at the end of 2014.</p><p>Nevertheless, Jonathan’s contributions were not overlooked as New Orleans Saints honored their former player in 2017 by inducting him into the New Orleans Saints Hall of Fame.</p><h3>Post Retirement: ESPN</h3><p>Since retiring from the NFL in 2014, Vilma has worked as a college football analyst for the ESPN network.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Vilma-Working-as-Broadcaster-300x182.png><p>In just a short space of time, Jonathan has established himself as one of the best analysts of the game who provides in-depth knowledge like no other.</p><h2>How old is Jonathan Vilma? Height & Nationality</h2><p>Talking about his age, Jonathan was born in 1982, which makes him 41 years old.</p><p>Likewise, the football player’s birthday falls on the 16th of April, which makes his horoscope Aries.</p><p>Furthermore, Vilma was born in the state of Florida, which makes his nationality American. Moving on, Vilma stands at 6 feet 1 inch (1.95 meters) and weighs 230 lb (104 kg).</p><p>Although his athletic body may not be of use anymore in the analysis studio, contrarily, back in the day, Jonathan used his body to its full potential en route to becoming one of the best linebackers of his era.</p><h2>Jonathan Vilma: Career Stats</h2><table
