<time>27 Feb 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p><strong>THE Daniel, Lyons and McGovern crime clans are currently major forces in the underworld . . . but experts reckon they won’t be for much longer.</strong></p><p>We can reveal more than HALF of Scotland’s 238 gangs are family-based.</p><p>But they are now being squeezed out by mobs who recruit members based on ability — and by major foreign gangs muscling in on their territories.</p><p>In our guide to organised crime in the 21st century Investigations Editor<br>RUSSELL FINDLAY looks at the families who’ve blighted communities — and how their days are numbered</p><p>JUST like most of our family-owned corner shops before them, Scotland’s crime clans now face being put out of business by rivals who are bigger — and more ruthless.</p><p>The small groups of relatives who have ruled their neighbourhoods by fear for decades are under pressure from all sides.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/2246172.main_image.jpg><p>In some cases they are competing against highly organised networks with international links who carry out smuggling and financial operations with<br>all the efficiency of a supermarket chain.</p><p><i>Another threat comes from foreign gangs embedded within the country’s melting pot of immigrant communities.</i></p><p>Finally, the crime clans face being dismantled by the police — who find it simpler to work out what they’re doing precisely because of their high local profiles and close family connections.</p><p>Leading criminologist Prof David Wilson, of Birmingham University, reckons these groups are more prominent in Scotland than the rest of the UK — but must adapt or die.</p><p>He said: “The old family units are no longer truly the face of what we call organised crime. It’s much more flexible than that.</p><p>“They may have their roots in the old clan system which evolved at first to provide protection and maximise profit.</p><p>“But what we are seeing now is that those groups are definitely not as important as they might have been in the past.</p><p>“You still see families involved in organised criminality with different members playing various roles.</p><p>“But if they become notorious it is then much easier for the police to identify and target them.</p><p>“It is no longer a desirable thing to establish a reputation like the Krays because all it does is attract the wrong kind of attention.”</p><p>The late Glasgow ‘Godfather’ Arthur Thompson Snr dreamed of building a crime dynasty — but his offspring weren’t up to the task.</p><p>Arthur Jnr was shot dead in 1991 — a crime for which former gangster Paul<br>Ferris stood trial and was found not guilty..</p><p>Another son, Billy, became a drug addict while his daughter Margaret died of a heroin overdose in 1987.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/2246175.main_image.jpg><p>A small number of Scots gangs — such as the Glasgow-based Daniel mob — have expanded beyond their traditional heartlands.</p><p>Some have links to feared family groups south of the border, like the Adams and Arif families in London.</p><p>The Adams clan has an estimated fortune of £200million and has been linked to 25 underworld slayings.</p><p>But Detective Chief Superintendent John Cuddihy, boss of Police Scotland’s organised crime division, believes that small family gangs are vulnerable to major global organisations.</p><p><i>And he reckons bigger gangster networks have the edge because they give jobs based on ability, not bloodlines.</i></p><p>He said: “Organised crime groups at the higher end — ones that cross police force boundaries and operate internationally — are built on the same structure as a business.”</p><p>Police Scotland’s organised crime experts reckon at least 25 foreign gangs operate here.</p><p>They include Chinese Triads — who run cannabis farms and flog bootleg DVDs — people-traffickers from the Czech Republic and Bangladesh plus Caribbean<br>Yardies who peddle crack cocaine and prostitutes.</p><p>Senior detectives have also voiced their concern over a move by the ultra-violent Albanian Mafia into the vice and drugs markets in Scotland.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/2246179.main_image.jpg><p>In 2009 there were reckoned to be 367 serious organised crime groups in Scotland. Today there are only 238.</p><p>That suggests a huge amount of “rationalisation” among gangs, with smaller ones being taken over.</p><p>But Gordon Meldrum, who retired recently as organised crime director at the National Crime Agency, says we should never glamorise thugs.</p><p>He explained: “Any view of these people as like something out of The Sopranoscan give a role model for young men to aspire to.</p><p>“These criminals put pressure on good people every day. None should ever be glamorised and none are ever ‘untouchable’.</p><p>“They should always be looking over their shoulder — they will never know when we’re going to put our hand on it.”</p><h2>Battling to stay at No1 - The Daniels</h2><p>THE feared family built a multi-million pound crime empire from the “jungle” in Glasgow’s Possil.</p><p>They remain the country’s most powerful mob, despite being weakened by a feud with the Lyons and the ill-health of boss Jamie.</p><p>His sister Annette Daniel, 52, was jailed last year for a £2,000 shoplifting spree and younger clan members have also been locked up.</p><p>But the family still has its hand in drugs, metal theft, car crime, shoplifting and protection, as well as tobacco and booze smuggling.</p><p>They also struck deals with smaller gangs for drugs and muscle.</p><h2>Sword bloodbath - The Malavins</h2><p>BROTHERS Zac, 21, and Angus, 32, hacked Andrew Curran to death in a park with a sword in 2010.</p><p>The murder stemmed from a Curran relative urinating in Zac’s Buckfast. The 41-year-old victim’s friend James McGregor was also shot with a crossbow and<br>suffered sword wounds.</p><p>In 2014 another brother Kris, 27, was jailed for seven years for driving his car over McGregor, almost killing him.</p><h2>Shot dead at garage - The Lyons</h2><p>BOSS Eddie Lyons Snr ran a community centre with the backing of Glasgow City Council and the cops — until a bloody war erupted with the Daniel clan.</p><p>In 2006 the hood’s nephew Michael, 21, was shot dead at a garage owned by his brother David near his base in the city’s Lambhill.</p><p>Gunmen James McDonald and Raymond Anderson were jailed over the attack, which also wounded Robert Pickett and another nephew Stephen Lyons.</p><p>The controversial Chirnsyde community centre was later closed and its former boss Eddie Snr and his clan were mostly driven out of Glasgow.</p><p>But the family still have contacts in the Paisley underworld and with drug smugglers in Spain.</p><h2>Murder & betrayals - The McGoverns</h2><p>THE family rose to prominence in the 1990s as the self-styled McGovernment. A feud with lieutenant Jamie “Iceman” Stevenson resulted in the 2000 murder of<br>Tony McGovern which remains unsolved.</p><p>The outfit sided with gangland killer Robert “Birdman” O’Hara in a bid to tackle Stevenson.</p><p>But it backfired when O’Hara and Iceman became pals.</p><p>O’Hara was caged for life for the murder of rival Paul McDowall in 2005, while<br>Stevenson served time for money laundering.</p><p>The McGoverns still exert power in their heartland of Springburn, Glasgow.</p><h2>Caged for knifing pal - The Haldanes</h2><p>THEY started out as relatively unknown enforcers for the Daniels.</p><p>But the family have since drifted away to carve out a reputation for drug dealing and violence in their native Possil, Glasgow.</p><p>Mark Haldane, 30, is serving at least 16 years for fatally stabbing pal Mark<br>Conway through the heart at his home in November 2010.</p><p>His younger brother Duncan Haldane was just 16 when he was caught with £80,000 of heroin in 2008.</p><p>Cops nabbed the teenager with the drugs stuffed down his trouser leg after tailing a minicab he was in. They then found a carrier bag packed with a kilo of smack.</p><h2>Tortured & burned - The Faulds</h2><p>BRIAN “Nightmare” Faulds was part of a violent gang in Glasgow’s Dalmarnock.</p><p>The crook, 29, who once showed off his gun and knife wounds to a TV crew, was tortured, killed and burned in 2011.</p><p>After his body was found brother Darren, 35, told the BBC he wasn’t thinking of “anything bar revenge obviously”.</p><p>His father Ronald and uncles David and Robert have been linked to drug dealing and violence.</p><h2>History of violence - The Wingates</h2><p>THE family has long-standing links to violence and drug dealing in their native Paisley.</p><p>David Wingate, 38 — once cleared of murder — was shot dead as he left a nightclub in the town in 1998.</p><p>Three years later, William Wingate, 43, was jailed for seven years for stabbing a man to death in Glasgow.</p><p>Last year, drug dealer Peter Wingate, 44, was caught with heroin, cocaine and a home-made blade in his prison cell.</p><h2>Yob links to terror - The Hamiltons</h2><p>THEY revel in ties to Loyalist organised crime groups in Northern Ireland and have preyed on residents in their Ayrshire patch for years.</p><p>Boss Eric, 51, was jailed in 1998 after being caught with ammo and terrorist uniforms.</p><p>Son William, 32, was locked up in 2007 for a machete attack. And another son<br>Eric Jr, 30, centre — nicknamed Tyson — was caged in 2004 for drug dealing and being in possession of a shotgun.</p><h2>Coming tomorrow: Blood on the streets</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqecsKtfaYB5g5ZonZqlmaG2pr%2BMmqtmr5GneqS%2ByKacZpuclru0ec%2BuqqGdlGK8tsCMm7Bmnp%2BnsqqzzWaemqaXqHqiusNmpKiao6mys7%2BO</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ffamilies-at-war-crime-clans-pushed-out-by-foreign-gangs-and-mobsters.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2ffamilies-at-war-crime-clans-pushed-out-by-foreign-gangs-and-mobsters.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2ffamilies-at-war-crime-clans-pushed-out-by-foreign-gangs-and-mobsters.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2ffamilies-at-war-crime-clans-pushed-out-by-foreign-gangs-and-mobsters.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ffamilies-at-war-crime-clans-pushed-out-by-foreign-gangs-and-mobsters.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2ffamilies-at-war-crime-clans-pushed-out-by-foreign-gangs-and-mobsters.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./corey-davis-jr.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./corey-davis-jr.html>Fame | Corey Davis Jr. net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./alex-murdoch-19880917-html.html>Alex Murdoch (YouTube Star) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./alex-murdoch-19880917-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
