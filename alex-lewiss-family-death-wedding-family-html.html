<time>08 Feb 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>Designer Alex Lewis lived an ordinary life as a pub landlord and a stay-at-home dad with his loving girlfriend and son. However, his life changed overnight when he contracted a streptococcal infection.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-8 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>What would have caused mild inconvenience for most people turned lethal for Lewis. He happened to have an infrequent reaction to the infection. It gave him blood poisoning and multiple organ failures, eventually leading him to become a quadruple amputee.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>After his life took an unexpected turn, he found himself in a position he would have never dreamt of. Thankfully, his girlfriend and son’s presence helped him cope with the disaster and turn a new page in his life. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>Alex Lewis’s Streptococcal Infection led to Sepsis</h2><p>In November of 2013, Lewis caught a cold. As his partner&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">ran</a> the pub&nbsp;he owned, he thought he contracted the flu from one customer. So, he dismissed it, as something minor and didn’t pay it much heed. <span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-10 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-9 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>However, when he woke up on the 17th of November, his skin had started turning purple. Excruciating pain assaulted him, and he grew semi-conscious. Lucy Townsend, his girlfriend, called for an ambulance and rushed him to the hospital.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>The doctors&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">diagnosed</a>&nbsp;him with Streptococcal toxic shock syndrome (STSS), a rare but serious bacterial infection that led to Septicaemia (also known as sepsis).&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-614 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>At the time, his vital organs had to be supported mechanically, and his blood was being forced around his body using norepinephrine, a chemical that helps increase heart rate and blood pumping.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Looking at his severe condition, the doctors said he had&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">less than a 3% chance of survival</a>. But thankfully, he survived&nbsp;after multiple surgeries and near-to-death experience.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p><strong>Alex Lewis post-surgery.</strong>&nbsp;(Photo: Dailymail)</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>Unfortunately, he had lost all his limbs over multiple months. Worse still, he had to undergo facial reconstruction as the infection had ravaged his face, leaving him with no lips.</p><h2>Lewis Lost All of His Four Limbs and Lips to the Condition</h2><p>The rare condition took away his limbs and lips. But the doctors could&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">graft the skins of his shoulder&nbsp;</a>around his mouth. He had then “lips tattoed onto the skin.” <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>Dailymail<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">&nbsp;reports</a>&nbsp;that it was the world-first surgery done on someone to medically tattoo a face.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-171 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>"The truth is that if you offered me my legs, arms and face back I wouldn't take them...This whole process has been a blessing more than curse," Lewis stated to FEMAIL.</p><h2>His Family Supported Him with Love and Care during the Difficult Time</h2><p>After 250 hours of surgery and more than 35 skin grafts, Lewis’s body was much different than before. It recovered well, but the loss of his arms and lips hit him hard.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>The thing that devastated him the most was how his son Sam was scared of his change.</p><p>But as a stay-at-home dad, he was incredibly close to his son. So, the two managed to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">re-establish</a> their previous relationship&nbsp;slowly. And he also relearned how to walk, eat, and do other primary actions with his fake limbs.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>During his recovery phase, his partner, Lucy, was also supportive of him throughout and after the surgeries. She helped him pull through, and their relationship grew stronger, so much so that Lewis even&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">proposed</a>&nbsp;to Lucy in 2015.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-618 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Hollywoodmask hasn’t found any follow-up news regarding their wedding or marriage. But the family-of-three lives <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">together</a> and provides love and support to one another. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-5 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Lewis Moves on to Set Example for Son</h2><p>Despite having lost all of his limbs, Lewis continued living a very fulfilling life. In an&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">interview</a>&nbsp;with the Metro in 2018, he revealed that he didn’t want his disability to win over his dreams. He also emphasized that he wanted to show his son Sam that his disability could never stop him from doing the things he wanted.</p><p>“He’s fine about everything now, and everything I do is to show that disability is not a problem, you just have to push on to find a way," he said.</p><p>"He sees me as quite resilient, and as he gets older he just accepts that this is me. I don’t want him to see me as someone who needs help.”</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>In addition to that,&nbsp;Lewis&nbsp;has shown determination to live a fulfilling life.&nbsp;In 2019, the larger-the-life persona&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">visualized</a> the interior&nbsp;for a hotel called The Grosvenor in Stockbridge through his iPad. In the same year, he also&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">climbed</a> an Ethiopian mountain.</p><p>When he is not designing stuff or spending time with his family, he speaks worldwide on topics like design, motivation, engineering, disability, and resilience.</p><h2>'The Extraordinary Case of Alex Lewis' Told His Story</h2><p>Alex Lewis’s fight with Sepsis, his recovery, and his brave determination to lead a normal life being a person with quadriplegia has been an inspiration to people worldwide. So, it is no surprise that a documentary has been made based on his journey. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-175 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Directed by Leonardo Machado, his&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">documentary</a>&nbsp;is titled&nbsp;The Extraordinary Case of Alex Lewis.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGicp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX5a5psSMpZywoaOoeqetzKKjsmWUmq61tIywnJ2cmaO0brLApqClsV6dwa64</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2falex-lewiss-family-death-wedding-family-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2falex-lewiss-family-death-wedding-family-html.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2falex-lewiss-family-death-wedding-family-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2falex-lewiss-family-death-wedding-family-html.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2falex-lewiss-family-death-wedding-family-html.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2falex-lewiss-family-death-wedding-family-html.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./hannah-meloche.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./hannah-meloche.html>Hannah Meloche Biography, Wiki, Age, Height, Net Worth, TikTok Career</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./mc-prophet-gdsb-html.html>MC Prophet (Rapper) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./mc-prophet-gdsb-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
