Aubrey stunned in a red one-shoulder gown with a thigh-slit and a cut-out under one of her breasts. The entire&nbsp;White Lotus: Sicily&nbsp;cast was all smiles as they posed with each other and celebrated the second season of the hit show.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/White-Lotus-Season-2-Premiere-SS-embed-3.jpg><h2>What Will Happen In Season 2?</h2><p id=content-paragraph-19>Season 2 of&nbsp;The White Lotus&nbsp;is going to be “totally different” than season 1, according to Aubrey Plaza. “I know it’s a lot to live up to, but Mike is so good about making the second season different,” the actress told&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Entertainment Tonight</a> in August. “It’s still ‘The White Lotus,’ but now it’s in Italy, so it has a totally different vibe and so, I think people are going to be surprised.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-20>Aubrey told&nbsp;EW&nbsp;in September that&nbsp;season 2 has “more intense drama and plot twists” than the first season. “It’s more heightened in the way that it made sense for the stories that happened on this volcanic island,” she said. “Of course the stories and the characters are more volcanic because that was the energy in Sicily.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-21>Creator Mike White, who also directs and produces the series, told <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Deadline&nbsp;</a>that&nbsp;The&nbsp;<i>White Lotus:&nbsp;Sicily&nbsp;</i>will deal with “a new mystery” that involves “sexual politics.” In an interview with&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Vulture</a>, Mike confirmed that a major storyline will involve the frenemy relationship between Aubrey and Meghann’s characters. He also said he wanted to stray away from “colonialism” in the second season. “I didn’t know that I had the gumption to wade into those waters again, knowing I was going to get sniper fire from every direction,” he said. “Maybe the classic sexual politics, the naughty subversive stuff we’re getting into, will take the edge off a little bit from that.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/The-White-Lotus-Season-2-HBO-embed-1-1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-22>Mike shared more about the new season to&nbsp;EW&nbsp;in September. “The kind of mythology of Sicily, at least from the point of view of Americans, is the archetypal sexual politics and role play that you associate with, like, opera and the mafia and Italian romance. I felt like it should be more focused on men and women and relationships and adultery and have an operatic feel to it, so I pivoted,” he said about creating the second season.</p><p id=content-paragraph-23>Star Meghann Fahy described&nbsp;The White Lotus: Sicily&nbsp;as “more sinister” and “a little bit sexier” than&nbsp;The White Lotus: Hawaii. Returning star Jennifer Coolidge teased what’s in store for Tanya in Sicily. “She’s married to Greg and they’ve been married long enough now that the honeymoon is definitely over,” the Emmy Award winner told EW. “She’s going to be contending with that.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-24>Fans are hoping that there will be many more seasons of The White Lotus. Before the show got renewed for season 2, Mike White told <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>TVLine</a> how more installations of the franchise could work. “It would have to be a different hotel, like, say, The White Lotus: San Tropez or something,” he said. “I don’t think you can credibly have [all the Season 1 guests] on the same vacation again. But maybe it could be a Marvel universe type thing, where some of them would come back.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme9ahoK2dXaG8tcHSZqqemaOku25%2BjG1vbW9oaIFw</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhite-lotus-season-2-4847834.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwhite-lotus-season-2-4847834.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwhite-lotus-season-2-4847834.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwhite-lotus-season-2-4847834.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhite-lotus-season-2-4847834.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhite-lotus-season-2-4847834.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./morgan-wallen-parents.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./morgan-wallen-parents.html>Who Are Morgan Wallen's Parents?
