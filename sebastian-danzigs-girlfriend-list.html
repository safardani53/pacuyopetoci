People born in the Year of the Monkey pursue interests. If it's something they don't particularly enjoy, they'll sloppily complete the task. If it's something they're passionate about, they'll labor tirelessly until they achieve it. They have a long life full of vitality and wonder about the world. Relationships are important to monkeys as well. However, pampering children may be one of their flaws.</p><p>People born on July 1 have a zodiac sign of <strong>Cancer</strong>. Cancer, as represented by the crab, smoothly glides between sea and beach, symbolizing cancer's capacity to dwell in both emotional and material realms. Cancers are extremely perceptive, and their psychic powers materialize in physical settings. However, like the hard-shelled crabs, this water sign is eager to go to any length to defend itself emotionally. You'll need to build trust in order to get to know this sign!</p><p>Best known as the guitarist for the Canadian art-rock band Palaye Royale, he and lead singer Remington Leith were named champions of MTV’s Musical March Madness in 2014.
