The answer isn't exactly clear. The commissioner is the person who takes the blame for unpopular decisions, such as rule changes or contract holdouts. Roger himself is known for being a multi-millionaire who is rarely seen outside his luxury box at games and has become a sort of stand-in for "The Man" for dissatisfied sports fans.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>He's the person everyone loves to hate, and therefore, audiences can't resist the opportunity to vent their frustrations, even if the NFL Draft only happens once a year.
