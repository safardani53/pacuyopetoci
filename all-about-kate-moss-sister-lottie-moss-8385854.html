Kate's parents divorced when she was 14, according to a 1994 <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Spin</a> interview, and Peter went on to welcome Lottie with model Inger Moss in 1998.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The younger Moss started modeling at 16, in an issue of Teen Vogue, and by 18, had landed the cover of Vogue Paris. Lottie has said that being a Moss and being compared to her elder sister wasn't always easy, even if there were some perks. In a series of tweets from 2022, Lottie responded to social media commenters calling her a "<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>nepo baby</a>" and chalking her success up to her famous last name.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Lottie wrote that she was "<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>privileged being related to a huge model</a>," and added that she understood "its not fair that people who come from famous families are getting a leg up because of that."

The younger Moss told <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>The Sun</a> in 2023 that because of their 24-year age gap, she and Kate had struggled to have a strong relationship.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I love her.

She had 12 flower-crowned bridesmaids, including her 8-year-old daughter, Lila Grace, and her 13-year-old sister. When photographs of the wedding were publicized, her dad got a scouting call from Sarah Doukas — the same agent who discovered Kate decades earlier.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“He was the one who was there with Kate when she was scouted in the airport at 14,” Lottie told <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>You Magazine</a> in 2019. “So Sarah was, like, ‘Honestly, Peter, you should just box up your genes and give them to us.' ”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In 2017, Lottie spoke to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>W Magazine</a> about how “funny” her discovery was: “My mom was like, ‘Your sister is going to be so pissed.
