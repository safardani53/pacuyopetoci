Even though not all of her children are full biological siblings, she and Evan have created a wonderful blended family together.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Ashlee Simpson had her first child in 2008 with Pete Wentz.</h2><p>Way before her current husband came along, Ashlee was married to Fall Out Boy's Pete Wentz. In November of 2008, they gave birth to their son, Bronx Mowgli Wentz. But in 2011, Ashlee filed for divorce.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>Their marriage was plagued by rumors, which led to a messy breakup. But despite this, they're now on good terms and they share custody of Bronx. According to reports, the artist even takes his son along with him when he goes on tour.&nbsp;</p><p>A few years after their split, when both he and Ashlee moved on to start their own families, he <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">opened up</a> about what it's like to co-parent with Ashlee and Evan: "We co-parent really well. I have to say, I have really good co-parents to deal with."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>"[Ashlee and Evan] are both communicative and easy-going," he continued. "For Bronx, it’s basically the only life he’s really known. So it’s normal to him, and he’s really good at it. Our schedules can be crazy, so we’ve been good about making sure Bronx has balance."</p><p>Ashlee also echoed his sentiments, explaining that they were all lucky to be on such great terms. She <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">said</a>: "I think the fact that there is a lot of respect amongst all of us, that it makes it easy. And we're all really close friends, and it's easy, it's nice. We got really lucky with that."</p><p>Even Evan has opened up about their co-parenting. He <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">said</a>: "My relationship with Pete has been amazing. He’s an amazing father. He knows I love his son very much, but it’s his son."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Ashlee had her second child with her husband, Evan Ross.</h2><p>After they wed in 2014, the 36-year-old singer gave birth to their daughter, Jagger Snow, in 2015.

She's given me the best gift in the world. I'm very lucky. She's the most beautiful thing you could ever think of.
