whose career path was inspired by her time in hospital and her diagnosis - went on asthma medication but none of it, or the “inhalers they prescribed, made a difference” which is when her dad became determined to get an accurate diagnosis.</p><p>“When I got told I had bronchiectasis, it was sort of a relief finally knowing what I had and what I could do to treat it.”</p><p>And this is where you might expect she embarked on a whole litany of medication and procedures, but no.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/NINTCHDBPICT000672135624.jpg><p>Instead of drugs, Priya found physio and exercise to have the greatest impact on her symptoms as they both help clear out her lungs really effectively.&nbsp;</p><p>“A lot of people are surprised by that because usually you don't think that if you've got a lung condition, running or doing any cardio exercise would make it better, but actually I found that it does,” says Priya.&nbsp;</p><p>“And so, up to this day, I don't take any medication.&nbsp;</p><p>“I just run a lot and do some physio in the mornings and evenings.”</p><h2 id=hit-the-road>HIT THE ROAD</h2><p>When Priya says she runs a lot, she means &lt;a lot> - around 300km a month, as well as doing marathons and ultra marathons.&nbsp;</p><p>“I used to love running at school but never, never, as far as I run now.</p><p>“I would never have imagined I could do ultras.”</p><p>Priya’s next ultra marathon is in March in Sri Lanka.</p><p>She’ll be running more than a marathon a day for five days straight - a total of 250km, all in aid of NHS Charities Together - followed by the Brighton Marathon in April, to raise money for the British Lung Foundation.</p><p>Priya says she wants to “encourage more people with chronic conditions, and specifically, chronic respiratory conditions, to do exercise, especially cardiovascular” to help manage their condition.</p><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">WHAT IS BRONCHIECTASIS?</h3></p><p>BRONCHIECTASIS is a long-term condition that affects the airways of the lungs.</p><p>Up to half of cases have no known cause, but in some cases it’s linked to other illnesses including asthma, COPD and lung infections, or inflammatory conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease and some types of arthritis.</p><p>Bronchiectasis should not be confused with the bronchiectasis caused by the genetic condition Cystic Fibrosis.</p><p><strong>SYMPTOMS</strong></p><ul><li>A cough that doesn’t go away and produces phlegm&nbsp;</li></ul><ul><li>Breathlessness</li></ul><ul><li>Frequent chest infections</li></ul><ul><li>Sinus problems</li></ul><p><strong>DIAGNOSIS</strong></p><p>If a doctor suspects bronchiectasis, a patient is referred to a respiratory consultant for tests.</p><p>They will then probably be given a CT scan and their sputum might well be analysed.</p><p>In some cases, a bronchoscopy might be offered – which is when a camera is inserted into a narrow tube to look into the lungs.</p><p><strong>TREATMENT</strong></p><p>Bronchiectasis is a chronic condition, but symptoms can be alleviated, and the number of infections limited with the following treatments:</p><ul><li>Airway clearance (clearing mucus from the lungs with breathing exercises)</li></ul><ul><li>Deep breathing through the nose</li></ul><ul><li>A personalised self-management plan</li></ul><ul><li>Antibiotics used for flare-ups</li></ul><ul><li>Check-ups with a respiratory physiotherapist</li></ul><p>For more information on bronchiectasis, visit&nbsp;British Lung Foundation - The UK’s lung charity (<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">blf.org.uk</a>)&nbsp;or call the charity’s helpline on&nbsp;03000 030 555.</p><p>She says her ability to run longer and longer distances is actually a “silver lining” to her bronchiectasis.</p><p>“A lot of people think they can't do exercise or can't run because of [their condition], but I want to show people it is possible, and it's a great, great way to look after your health.”</p><p>For Priya, jogging is “very mental, as well as physical”.</p><p>“It gives me time just to be in my own head, to think over things,” she says.</p><p>“I can go at a really slow pace for like an hour and I'll feel as if I've had an hour-long therapy session.&nbsp;</p><p>“It just calms me down.”</p><p>That mental calm comes in handy considering the thinking is, ultra marathons are 90% mental and 10% physical.&nbsp;</p><p>“They are tough and you get to points where you're like, ‘I really want to stop!’ but then you push past that and it just helps build your resilience.</p><p>“And that's what I love about ultras, they're just such a challenge, but you feel so good afterwards,” she says.</p><h2 id=get-moving>GET MOVING</h2><p>Although of course, not all of us will suddenly start running ultras - chronic condition or otherwise - but just a little bit of cardiovascular exercise could make all the difference to your health.</p><p>“I find that when you exercise, all the air is moving in your chest and that helps bring up anything that could be stuck in your bronchi and clears out the airways,” says Priya, who doesn’t experience shortness of breath as one of her symptoms.</p><p>On “bad days” she might need an extra pillow to prop her up and help her sleep and not cough, meanwhile “summer tends to be easier”.&nbsp;</p><p>It's in winter that her symptoms get worse.&nbsp;</p><p>“You're more at risk for getting pneumonia or chest infections over winter, so I have to be quite careful,” she says.</p><p>Between her running, TV commitments and medical studies - Priya is set to graduate in 2023, and is considering specialising in orthopaedic surgery - finding time to date must be difficult?</p><p>“Oh gosh,” says Priya with a smile, “Yeah, it's tough.”</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>But surely not as tough as an ultra...</p><p>To support Priya's ultra marathon in Sri Lanka for NHS Charities Together visit <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">www.justgiving.com/campaign/priyagopaldas</a></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/NINTCHDBPICT000707962197.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/NINTCHDBPICT000707962195.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57x56YpayYZIF3g5FqaGpnnKTDpnnIrKOappSoerG%2ByLKYZp2dl66zvsCsqqKml2Kwqb7Op6CcZZiarq3Ax2anq6eSobKuew%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2flove-islands-priya-embarrassing-chronic-health-problem.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2flove-islands-priya-embarrassing-chronic-health-problem.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2flove-islands-priya-embarrassing-chronic-health-problem.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2flove-islands-priya-embarrassing-chronic-health-problem.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2flove-islands-priya-embarrassing-chronic-health-problem.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2flove-islands-priya-embarrassing-chronic-health-problem.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./quavo-net-worth-height-rapper.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./quavo-net-worth-height-rapper.html>What is Quavo's net worth and how tall is he?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./hailee-steinfelds-husband-list.html>Hailee Steinfelds Husband: Who is Hailee Steinfeld Dating?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./hailee-steinfelds-husband-list.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
