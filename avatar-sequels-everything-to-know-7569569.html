When <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>speaking to The Hollywood Reporter</a> in January 2023, Cameron revealed, “We decided we needed to leap way ahead to places that people couldn’t have predicted [for The Way of Water] and we’re gonna do that again with movie 3 as well."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The franchise's third installment is expected to hit theatres in 2025, with Avatar 4 following in 2029 and Avatar 5 in 2031.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">From the growing cast to the plot, here's everything to know about the upcoming Avatar sequels.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-is-avatar-3-about></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What is Avatar 3 about?&nbsp;</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>A scene from 'Avatar: The Way of Water'.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Courtesy of 20th Century Studios</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As with the previous Avatar projects, Cameron has remained incredibly quiet about the plot of Avatar 3. However, he did reveal one key aspect of the movie — when speaking to France’s 20 Minutes in early 2023, Cameron said the next sequel will center around <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>a new race of people</a> who personify another element.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“Fire will be represented by the Ash People,” Cameron told the program. “I want to show the Na'vi from another angle because, so far, I have only shown their good sides. In the early films, there are very negative human examples and very positive Na'vi examples. In Avatar 3, we will do the opposite."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Cameron also said that the Avatar storyline is just getting started. "We will also explore new worlds while continuing the story of the main characters," Cameron revealed. "I can say that the last parts will be the best. The others were an introduction, a way to set the table before serving the meal."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-when-will-avatar-3-be-released></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>When will Avatar 3 be released?</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Neytiri (Zoe Saldana) and Jake Sully (Sam Worthington) in 'Avatar: The Way of Water'.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner>20th Century Studios</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Originally, Avatar 3 was scheduled to release in December 2024, but Disney later altered its premiere lineup for a whole slew of film franchises, including Star Wars, Avengers and the Avatar sequels. Avatar 3 is now scheduled for a December 2025 release, with the later films arriving in 2029 and 2031.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Zoe Saldaña posted the news on Instagram</a> in June 2023 and joked about the delays. “Great!

Cameron took an atypical approach to the sequels and filmed Avatar 2 and 3 at the same time. He told <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Entertainment Weekly</a> in December 2022 that he did this to avoid his teenage actors appearing too old in the later films, comparing his dilemma to a popular Netflix series.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-34 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“I love Stranger Things, but you get the Stranger Things effect where they're supposed to still be in high school, and they look like they're 27," the director said.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-36 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Cameron specifically mentioned his concerns over star Jack Champion, who Cameron said was “growing like a weed.” The production team was also worried that COVID-19-related delays would force them to recast the final sequels.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-38 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“I was imagining scenarios where we don't go back to work for a year and a half and we're completely screwed because he's [Champion] aged out, and then we have to go back and reshoot with another guy," Cameron said. The director's worries did not come to fruition, though — the production team worked out a deal with the New Zealand government to let a small team continue filming in order to get the shots they needed.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-who-is-in-the-cast-of-avatar-3></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-40 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Who is in the cast of Avatar 3?</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-41 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Left: Sam Worthington attends the Hermes' SS24 Men's Show at Palais D'iena on June 24, 2023 in Paris, France.

However, in an Entertainment Weekly interview in 2022, Cameron said that on page 35 of the fourth film's script, there’s a big move forward in time, allowing the young actors to age up naturally within the film’s storyline.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-54 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“They're young men, young women at that point, when we get to the B side of that time jump,” he told the publication.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-56 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Cameron told PEOPLE more specifics on the plot's progression in December 2023.
