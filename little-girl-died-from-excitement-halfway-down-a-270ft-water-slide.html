The floor beneath them then gives way, sending them flying down nearly 300 feet of slide and gushing water at speed.</p><p>But as excited London shot through the tube, tragedy struck.</p><h2>'Somebody's drowned over there'</h2><p>"I heard a whistle go off," says her mum, who was sitting on the other side of the 50,000sq ft park, waiting for her two daughters and her husband Jerry, at the time.</p><p>"I was like, 'Oh, there's probably kids messing around. But within maybe minutes I started seeing women looking terrified. One woman was walking with two children, grabbing them.</p><p>"She said, 'Somebody's drowned over there.' I kind of got nervous."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/NINTCHDBPICT000486426978.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/NINTCHDBPICT000486426899.jpg><p>Deciding to call Jerry to check everything was OK, Tina quickly realised she had his phone. She then stood up and went to look for herself - and came across a horrifying sight.</p><p>"[Jerry] was looking down and there were sheets up and I knew it was one of my kids," she recalls.</p><p>"It was an awful thing. There were no signs of the condition, she just dropped.</p><p>"The day before she had been doing flips in the air."</p><h2>No signs of deadly heart condition</h2><p>She adds that attempts to save London's life didn't include the use of a defibrillator - which can reestablish a regular heartbeat via an electrical charge.</p><p>The youngster was taken from the Frankenmuth-based park to Covenant HealthCare in Saginaw, before being airlifted to the University of Michigan's children's hospital.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/NINTCHDBPICT000486427021.jpg><p><span>There, she was put on life support, as her distraught family prayed for her recovery.</span></p><p>"My husband and I took turns to stay," Tina explains.</p><p>"My daughter Eden still wanted to go to school. We tried to keep some kind of normalcy."</p><p>She adds: "The one night we both came home - I was just wanting to take a shower and come back - I got a phone call from my dad who was with her. She'd gone into cardiac arrest again."</p><h2>'I'm glad she made that choice for us'</h2><p>Doctors had told London's family she had suffered severe brain damage due to a lack of oxygen following her first cardiac arrest at the water park on February 18, 2018.</p><p>"I would have taken her home with the brain damage but I'm glad she made that choice for us," the mum adds. "She fought for nine days in hospital... then she gained her angel wings."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/NINTCHDBPICT000486427019.jpg><br><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">What is Long QT syndrome?</h3></p><p class=article__content--intro>Long QT syndrome, which London suffered from, is an inherited heart rhythm condition.</p><p>Sufferers' heart muscles takes longer than normal to recharge between beats. This means they can experience sudden, potentially deadly arrhythmias (abnormal heart rhythms).</p><p>The condition, which is inherited and affects around one in every 2,000 people, is a leading cause of sudden cardiac death in young, otherwise, healthy people, according to the <a data-mce-href=https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/long-qt-syndrome/ href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">NHS</a>.</p><p>Symptoms of the condition may include blackouts or fainting, seizures and heart palpitations, which can begin unexpectedly and be triggered by factors like stress and strenuous exercise.</p><p>However, some people may not have any symptoms. For example, in London's case, the little girl had 'no signs' of the hidden condition and appeared to be 'very, very healthy' and active.</p><p>While sufferers' hearts typically regain a normal rhythm following arrhythmias, sometimes they continue to beat abnormally and the person goes into a life-threatening cardiac arrest.</p><p>Treatment for Long QT syndrome includes medication like beta-blockers and, in severe cases, the fitting of a pacemaker.</p><p>London passed away on February 27 and was laid to rest on March 3 in her special daddy-daughter dance dress, with thousands of people turning up to say goodbye.</p><p>"She was buried in the dress," says Tina, of Grand Blanc. "I didn't have a chance to buy shoes. She looked like an angel with her dress and no shoes. She really did look like a sleeping beauty."</p><p>She adds that her daughter 'just loved everybody' - and was adored in return.</p><p>"She was a gymnast on a team, very very into sport and loved her family," she tells us.</p><p>"She had to be the centre of attention all the time, the class clown.</p><p>"She always wanted to see everybody be happy, she never wanted to see anybody sad."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/NINTCHDBPICT000486427018.jpg><p>She adds: "London loved to spend time with us. She would always say, I'm so lucky to have you as my mum and you as my dad and Eden as my sister. She loved animals, especially cats."</p><p>Following London's death, Tina trained to become an instructor for the American Heart Association, and she and Jerry set up the non-profit <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">London Strong Foundation</a> in their daughter's name.</p><p>The foundation grants defibrillators within the local community in an effort to save lives.</p><h2>'You have to respond - you don't have time to wait'</h2><p>These portable devices, which are used to treat patients in sudden cardiac arrest, can analyse the heart's rhythm and deliver an electrical shock to help reestablish an effective rhythm.</p><p>And Tina says this 'proper response' is needed in such emergencies.</p><p>"You have to respond, you don't have time to wait, " she says. "I think people are afraid of defibrillators, but they're very easy to use. They're what is needed to bring back the rhythm."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/NINTCHDBPICT000486426901.jpg><p>The foundation also donates to pet rescues, in tribute to London's love of animals.</p><p>Today, London's family are living an 'ongoing nightmare' without her.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Top stories in news</h2></p><p>Heartbroken Tina says every breath is painful and she cries herself to sleep every night.</p><p>In a message to other parents, she adds: "You never know when it's going to happen. You never think it's going to happen to you and this is not a club you want to be part of.</p><p>"Cherish every moment you have with your family."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqecsKtfbYZ3gZdsbmikmanBrbGMoKCrpF2ZtqawjJ%2BpqKVdmsWktdOepJ6mpGK1orjFsJiyZZSkxK95wGZpcGiWqXq4rdOeqWarnJ6xpns%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2flittle-girl-died-from-excitement-halfway-down-a-270ft-water-slide.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2flittle-girl-died-from-excitement-halfway-down-a-270ft-water-slide.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2flittle-girl-died-from-excitement-halfway-down-a-270ft-water-slide.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2flittle-girl-died-from-excitement-halfway-down-a-270ft-water-slide.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2flittle-girl-died-from-excitement-halfway-down-a-270ft-water-slide.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2flittle-girl-died-from-excitement-halfway-down-a-270ft-water-slide.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./show-true-colours-meaning-origins-explained.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./show-true-colours-meaning-origins-explained.html>People are only just realising where the phrase 'show your true colours' comes from and they can't b</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./karen-yapoort-encarnacion-19890803-html.html>Karen Yapoort Encarnacin (Presentadore de Programas de TV) - Edad, cumpleaos, biografa, hechos</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./karen-yapoort-encarnacion-19890803-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
