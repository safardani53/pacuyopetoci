<time>25 May 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>IF YOU could pay less for your favourite cult products then would you?<br>With Beauty Pie, you actually can.</p><p>Its business model is based on the claim that most make-up and skincare is branded and marked up before it hits shelves despite all being produced in the same lab.</p><p>By dropping the branding process, Beauty Pie can sell the same products for up to 80 per cent less than its usual RRP.</p><p>We tested out the key products from the brand’s Summer Edit to see if it’s as good as it sounds.</p><h2>Beauty Pie Review</h2><ul><li><strong>Join Beauty Pie <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">here</a></strong></li></ul><h3><strong>Pros</strong></h3><ul><li>You can read reviews before choosing each product</li><li>Everything is 100 percent cruelty-free</li><li>Pay less for great quality products</li><li>Range of products including skincare, bodycare and makeup</li><li>Unused spending limit rolls over to next month</li><li>£10 monthly pass available to trial before committing to a £59 annual fee</li></ul><h3><strong>Cons</strong></h3><ul><li>The true formulas are a mystery because of the lack of branding</li><li>Membership only unlocks reduced prices</li></ul><h2>How does Beauty Pie work?</h2><p><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Beauty Pie</a> is a 100 per cent cruelty-free beauty membership service which stocks its own-brand skincare, makeup, haircare, body care and even supplements, all for a fraction of the usual, store-bought price.</p><p>There are options from all over the world, including Japan, Korea, France and Switzerland, to name a few.</p><p>There are two membership options: a day pass or a £59 annual subscription.

Wondergloss Collagen Lip Oil</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/IMG-3053-rotated.jpg><ul><li><strong>Wondergloss Collagen Lip Oil in Nude Nectar, from £7.20 from Beauty Pie - <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">buy here</a></strong></li></ul><p>Lip gloss has come a long way since its outing back in the early noughties. Gone are the days of sticky formulas that are flytraps for any loose hair or dust, and now lip oils have come to the fore as an improved version of the classic.</p><p>Beauty Pie's Wondergloss is the epitome of what a modern lip oil should be: lightweight, hydrating and crucially, not tacky.</p><p>The colour is very sheer, adding just a hint of rosiness to the lips when worn on its own, or it can turn your matte lipstick into a glossy dream with a single swipe.</p><p>The doe-foot applicator makes the smallest amount easy to spread over lips, which is ideal because a small amount is all you'll need.</p><p>The gloss has quite a strong, sweet scent so you'll either fall into the love it or hate it camp depending on how you feel about scented makeup products.</p><p>The packaging looks and feels well made and the design is very clean.</p><p>Collagen works with the shine of the gloss to make lips look juicier, giving the illusion of natural plumpness.</p><p>Despite how good this lip oil is, it isn't a miracle worker, so it will need topping up throughout the day to keep the shine consistent.</p><h2>2. Flawless Eyeshadow Primer</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/IMG-3050-rotated.jpg><ul><li><strong>Flawless Eyeshadow Primer, from £8.65 from Beauty Pie - <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">buy here</a></strong></li></ul><p>Eyeshadow primers are key to long-lasting eye makeup. Not only does a good one grip onto the product so it doesn't slide around, but it can also make colours more vibrant.</p><p>And Beauty Pie's Flawless Eyeshadow Primer is a good one.</p><p>Unlike so many on the market, it twists open to reveal a doe-foot applicator making it easy to dot a small amount onto the lid and blend in with either a brush or your finger.</p><p>The consistency is like that of a concealer, and it looks like a concealer when it comes out of the tube, too.</p><p>Its biggest draw is that it colour-corrects the lid so you have a neutral, smooth base to apply your powder shadows on without them creasing or separating.</p><p>A top tip for the longest-lasting results: pat a little translucent powder over the top of the primer before applying the rest of your eye makeup.</p><h2>3. Super Healthy Skin Featherlight UVA/UVB SPF 50 Sunscreen + Primer</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/IMG-3049-rotated.jpg><ul><li><strong>Super Healthy Skin Featherlight UVA/UVB SPF 50 Sunscreen + Primer, from £12.34 from Beauty Pie - <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">buy here</a></strong></li></ul><p>It's common knowledge that SPF is crucial for preventing signs of ageing like lines and wrinkles and, more importantly, protecting against harmful UV rays.</p><p>However, it can feel overwhelming having a huge list of products in your daily routine so one of the first steps people often decide to scrap is SPF. If this is you, let us introduce you to this SPF + Primer from Beauty Pie because it's the ultimate two-in-one.</p><p>The “featherlight” in the SPF's name is exactly how it feels; it's thin and weightless as it smooths over skin without leaving behind a greasy trail,&nbsp;but it still gives a healthy glow.</p><p>It does smell like suncream, but it doesn't feel like one you might use on your body. In fact, it feels more like skincare, gliding lightly over skin, hydrating and blurring as it goes.</p><p>The packaging looks modern and sleek giving it an expensive feel, even though it only costs £12.34 with a Beauty Pie membership.</p><h2>4. Soul Providers Energizing Body Wash</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/IMG-3046-rotated.jpg><ul><li><strong>Soul Providers Energizing Body Wash, from £10.30 from Beauty Pie - <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">buy here</a></strong></li></ul><p>The orange colour of this body wash is a good indicator of how zesty the scent is. If you've ever used Sanctuary Spa, it smells exactly like its hand washes.</p><p>It leaves skin feeling smooth and soft once it has been washed away and the bright scent lingers, so you feel genuinely clean.</p><p>Press down on the lid to flick open the cap and then squeeze the bottle to release the product evenly into your hand before using.</p><p>If you're someone who enjoys making the most of their products, then double up this body wash as your bubble bath because the smell and how much it lathers makes for an invigorating, bubbly experience.</p><p>Considering this would cost £30 without a Beauty Pie subscription, £10.30 for 250ml is a bargain.</p><h2>5. Plantastic Apricot Butter Cleansing Balm</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/IMG-3047-rotated.jpg><ul><li><strong>Plantastic Apricot Butter Cleansing Balm, from £19.18 from Beauty Pie - <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">buy here</a></strong></li></ul><p>This one's a little pricier at £19.18. However, it's been marked down from £50 so when compared, it seems a lot more reasonable.</p><p>And it does live up to its price tag. The packaging is heavy and feels expensive, coming with a little scoop to apply the perfect amount of product.</p><p>In the pot, the balm looks whipped and had a mousse-like texture, but as soon as it goes on to dry skin, it becomes oilier.</p><p>Once you've allowed it to melt away your makeup and the day's grime by massaging the balm into your skin using circular motions, add some water so it lathers before wiping away with a damp muslin cloth or flannel.</p><p>It removes all traces of makeup and leaves skin looking refreshed and feeling soft.</p><p>The scent is summery and it uses ingredients like vitamin E to support healthy skin and rosehip oil to moisturise and hydrate.</p><p>It’s cruelty-free, too.</p><h2>6. Deluxe Precision Liquid Eyeliner</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/IMG-3072-rotated.jpg><ul><li><strong>Deluxe Precision Liquid Eyeliner, from £9.22 from Beauty Pie - <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">buy here</a></strong></li></ul><p>If you've incorporated a liquid liner into your makeup look, then it's likely the standout feature. Whether you've gone for a full-on cat-eye or simply played around with subtle graphic lines, it can make or break a look.</p><p>The Deluxe Precision Liquid Eyeliner from Beauty Pie ticks all of the eyeliner boxes. It glides over the lid without catching so that the line is smooth.</p><p>The point is thin meaning that, as the name suggests, getting a precise line or flick is simple and the tip means you can get right down to the lash line and build up the thickness for ultimate control.</p><p>It's a deep black, which makes eyelashes look fuller and the liner looks intentional rather than wishy-washy. This liner is all about controlled impact.</p><p>It doesn't smudge or slide and you'll only notice it wipe away after many hours of wear. This is one to add to your makeup bag pronto.</p><h2>7. Arch-ology Tinted Eyebrow Sculpting Gel</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/IMG-3051-rotated.jpg><ul><li><strong>Arch-ology Tinted Eyebrow Sculpting Gel, from £8.44 from Beauty Pie - <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">buy here</a></strong></li></ul><p>Brow gels are the ultimate everyday go to because they give definition in seconds. Arch-ology is a tinted brow gel that holds hairs in place while adding a little colour, giving the effect of fuller brows without having to worry about precision.</p><p>The spoolie that dispenses the product is small so you have full control over the areas you're applying it to.</p><p>It doesn't clog so you won't need to do a cleanup job afterwards but for the most seamless brows, run through the hairs with a clean spoolie so the product is distributed as evenly as possible.</p><h2>8. Superdose Vitamin C Oxygen Boosting Moisturizer</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/IMG-3073-rotated.jpg><ul><li><strong>Superdose Vitamin C Oxygen Boosting Moisturizer, from £14.68 from Beauty Pie - <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">buy here</a></strong></li></ul><p>This is a luxe moisturiser — the RRP price of £50 tells us that, even if we don't know what brand name the stout, white tube would usually bear.</p><p>But it's not only the price that fits into the 'luxe' bracket. The consistency of the moisturiser as it comes out of the tube is rich and creamy and immediately feels refreshing when massaged in.</p><p>The scent of the daily cream is subtle and natural so it's perfect for those of you who aren't crazy about heavily scented beauty products or if you've got sensitive skin.</p><p>It includes brightening vitamin C and the formula is vegan, cruelty-free and clean, so you won't find anything other than natural ingredients in this one.</p><p>Because it includes vitamin C but doesn't have SPF built into it, be sure to follow the moisturiser with a dedicated SPF (like the Featherlight which we mentioned earlier) because the zesty ingredient makes skin more sensitive to the sun.</p><h2>Is Beauty Pie worth it?</h2><p>Without stating the obvious, we love the concept of being able to buy high-quality products at reasonable prices, so Beauty Pie was already in our good books before we had even tried it out.</p><p>However, it's clear that every product is high quality, and each offering comes completely full size - you won't catch any sample sizes around here.</p><p>The membership works out at just under £5 a month and with the brand currently offering a 60 day free trial (with a spending limit of £3,600) you can try before you buy.</p><p>But for the products that are on offer and the significant markdown, we think this is well worth the cost of one of your morning coffees every month.</p><ul><li><strong>Join Beauty Pie <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">here</a></strong></li></ul><h2>What are Pie Days?</h2><p>Over the course of a year, Beauty Pie gives its members four to six Pie Days, and annual members get double that.</p><p>On a Pie Day, members can shop a chosen Beauty Pie product without using up any of their month's spending limit, so make sure you don't miss out on them by keeping an eye on your emails.</p><p>Scheduled when there's enough stock of the particular item, Pie Days always coincide with your spending limit renewal day.</p><h2>Where does Beauty Pie get its products?</h2><p>Its products are sourced from 20 leading laboratories which are known for producing leading beauty brand formulas. Beauty Pie cuts out the middlemen, the retailer markup and celebrity marketing, and sells them for significantly lower prices.</p><p>Fun fact: the company make absolutely no money from the products, all of its revenue comes from memberships!</p><ul><li><strong>Join Beauty Pie <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">here</a></strong></li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-2-1.jpeg><h2>Are Beauty Pie products good quality?</h2><p>Yes, the items from Beauty Pie are the same high-quality products that you'll get if you bought leading brands from the shops.</p><h2>Is Beauty Pie a legitimate company?</h2><p>Beauty Pie was launched at the tail end of 2016 and has been providing its subscribers with savings ever since.</p><p>As we've mentioned, they're all about great products for the lowest possible prices and to this point, they've garnered rave reviews.</p><h2>How is Beauty Pie so cheap?</h2><p>Beauty Pie is cheaper than most leading cosmetic companies because it ditches the hefty markups used by most designer brands in favour of a subscription-based model.</p><h2>What's the catch with Beauty Pie?</h2><p>We're not sure it technically counts as a 'catch' but to claim the best prices you need to be a Beauty Pie member.</p><p>That means you'll still be making a substantial saving as long as you regularly purchase from them.</p><p>But if you forget you are subscribed and stop buying, technically, you're paying money for nothing.</p><p>As long as you stay on top of your subscriptions, there's no downside!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqysp2Wjmrmmr9OsZmpsYG2DcX2XaJmemaWpxm68yJ5kq52mnrK4ew%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fbeauty-pie-review.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fbeauty-pie-review.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fbeauty-pie-review.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fbeauty-pie-review.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fbeauty-pie-review.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fbeauty-pie-review.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./does-ron-desantis-wear-heels.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./does-ron-desantis-wear-heels.html>Does Ron DeSantis Wear Heels?
