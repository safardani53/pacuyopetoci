Indeed, Ashima’s climbing career has opened a number of doors in the best possible way.</p><p>Ashima initially kicked off by climbing Rat Rock at Central park and later climbed at Brooklyn Boulders in Gowanus, Brooklyn. And now, to our amazement, she is listed on the elite list of Richest Rock Climbers.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Ashima-Shiraishi-indoor-climbing.png><p>That must be the reason Ashima has a net worth of around $1 million to $5 million.</p><p>Ashima started coming into notice when she participated in national events and bagged the tag of the winner at the 2017 USA Climbing Sport & Speed Open National Championships Female Sports category.</p><p>No, by this, we did not mean to say she was unfamiliar before, but as Ashima grew up, she started hitting more popularity.</p><p>She finished second place at the USA Climbing Bouldering Nationals (ABS nationals) to ten-time champion Alex Puccio in 2017. The same year, Ashima made her Climbing World Cup debut as an adult.</p><p>To add up, prior to this, Ashima won the IFSC World Youth Championships for both Lead and Bouldering in the Female Youth B category in 2015, 2016, and 2017.&nbsp;</p><p>As aforementioned, Ashima was 14 when she conquered the climb &nbsp;Horizon (8C/V15) in Mount Hiei, Japan, the second person in the wide world to do this.&nbsp;</p><h3>Sponsorships</h3><p>Ashima Shiraishi is sponsored by climbing and outdoor brands, Evolve, The North Face, Petzl, and other superior brands like Nikkon and Coca-Cola Japan brands. She is also often seen wearing and flaunting Gucci Jackets.</p><p><a href=#>Read about Dean Potter’s Net Worth: Earnings & Sponsors</a></p><h3>Ashima signing with Coca-Cola, claim to fame or failure!</h3><p>Exactly on her sixteen birthday, April 3, Ashima announced her new partnership deal with Coca-Cola, a company that has just stepped into the world of rock-climbing sponsoring pro climbers.</p><p>It is the latter side if Ashima is getting benefitted from the sponsorship or not, but the only question that triggered fans and the public is Should the climbing commune welcomes the support from big drinks brands or fight back against their act of sweetness?</p><p>Let’s take a look at why this question gets raised. With Ashimas’s tide with Cocacola company, there came criticisms and appreciation as well.</p><p>Most so-called health-conscious people, social influencers, and opinionated climbers showered their disappointment. And some pointed out at Coke directly, saying, ” How dare they grab such a young girl? She’s only 16.)</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Signing-up-a-deal-with-CocaCola-companyAshima.png><p>Some of the fans showed disapproval, “Followers won’t cover your expenses, but you will lose the audience in becoming dependent on signing such a sponsorship. Climbing should remain a representation of freedom,” said one of the followers.</p><p>And some defamed the company as shit. While climbers like Conrad Anker, on the other hand, skipped the conspiracy and casually wished Ashima a happy birthday.</p><p>Well, this was all about comments, criticisms, and appreciation. But on a serious note, does it even matter? It’s just an endorsement deal.&nbsp;</p><p>Yes, as an athlete, we can understand that athletes should not be prioritizing sugary drinks or food because it is high in calories and cause overweight.</p><p>But above and overall, we all do know Ashima is a smart climber, she knows what she is doing, let her push her competitive level, and let the endorsement offers come in.</p><h2>Ashima Shiraishi Net Worth | Lifestyle</h2><p>Well, you will get both flavors when you see Ashima if you are getting it, what I mean. She is a young chirpy girl who gets professional and starts pushing her limits when it’s time to show her talent on the wall.</p><p>And at the same time, when Ashima gets into her personal space, she turns out to be this cute, bubbly girl who has ordinary wants and desires just like a simple girl next door doing all the eat, sleep repeat thing.</p><p>She looks like any other American girl with her thick blunt-cut bangs.</p><p>To meet her goals on a professional level, Ashima gets all busy with training camps where she keeps working hard, climbing daily from 9 to 5.</p><p>Not to mention, Ashima is a full-time student until now, but the rumors say she is planning to enroll at <strong>UCLA</strong>. However, she will remain a student for a few years at least.</p><p>Thus, it’s a seen and understood fact that Ashima’s schedule is quite tight. She has to take out time from her studies which usually happens on break, and get indulged in training. It’s an after-school affair.&nbsp;</p><h3>Ashima’s Diet</h3><p>She must be keeping much concern on her diet and fitness during the practice days as she knows she has a lot to achieve, more big moves to make for a big momentum.</p><p>Ashima follows a strict policy, “no food before the climb.” She just hates the fat that comes after eating when your stomach gets all bloated. She is more into eating properly after the climb to retain her energy.</p><p>Other than that, Ashima loves food and misses her lunch on school days in the cafeteria. She has a different obsession with baking banana bread.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Love-for-food-Ashima.png><p>“I just love to eat a lot that’s I got interested in trying to bake banana bread so I can use my own healthier ingredients. I’ve been discovering a healthy version of cinnamon rolls, cheesecake, zucchini bread, and birthday cakes for my parents.” Ashima said.</p><p>Ashima and her family love Japanese food like okonomiyaki, which is halfway between a crepe and an omelet—and covers more seafood than meat. Ashima’s favorite breakfast is Toast with peanut butter and honey.</p><p>During lunch hours, she prefers Pasta with marinara and zucchini. And when it’s munch time, Almonds, pistachios, and Chocolate Hazelnut CLIF Nut Butter Filled Energy Bar is her favorite. When it comes to dinner, Gyoza, rice, and okonomiyaki are counted in.</p><h3>Thrifting and Shopping</h3><p>Again, just like any other ordinary girl, Ashima loves clothing and fashion.
