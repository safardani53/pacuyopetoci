It was the first time seeing someone on the cover of a magazine that I could actually relate to. But it wasn't until I saw Ashley Graham on the cover of SI Swimsuit in 2016, where I stopped and said, "Wow, I can do this too". She had such a similar body type to mine, and we rarely get to see our bodies represented and praised upon in the media and modeling industry.

Growing up, everything that is beautiful about me was made out to be ugly and unacceptable. My skin tone, my height, my build and even my ethnicity. Those things have turned out to be my super powers. So it doesn't matter if you have different textured hair, short, freckled or have different perspectives. You were made beautifully and perfectly.
