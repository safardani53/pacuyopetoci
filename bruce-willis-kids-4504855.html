His eldest, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Rumer Willis</strong></a>&nbsp;took to <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram</a> on Dec. 20, 2022, to reveal that she <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>is pregnant</a> with her first child. She captioned the black-and-white photo of her <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>baby bump</a> with a growing plant emoji while her boyfriend,&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Derek Richard Thomas</strong></a>, kissed her growing belly. And on April 25, 2023, she revealed that <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>she and Derek welcomed their little one</a> on April 18. They named their daughter <strong>Louetta Isley Thomas Willis</strong> and called her “pure magic” in their<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> birth announcement</a>, seen below.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>Earlier, on March 30, 2022, Bruce’s family, including all five of his daughters, shared some devastating news with his fans on Instagram. The family revealed that the actor had recently been <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>diagnosed with aphasia</a>. In a joint statement from all five girls, as well as their moms — Bruce’s ex-wife, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Demi Moore</strong></a>, and current wife,&nbsp;<strong><a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Emma Heming Willis</a> — </strong>the family revealed Bruce would have to step away from acting, as the disease had begun to impair his cognitive abilities.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>Most recently, his wife,&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Emma Heming Willis</strong></a>, 45, gave a <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>health update</a> on Bruce during a September 25, 2023 interview with <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>TODAY</a>. When asked if the 68-year-old is aware of his ongoing <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>health condition</a>, Emma revealed that the answer is not clear. “Hard to know. It’s hard to know,” she said. She also expressed that the experience has been “hard” for her family. “What I’m learning is dementia is hard. It’s hard on the person diagnosed, it’s also hard on the family,” Emma explained. “And that is no different for Bruce, or myself, or our girls. When they say that this is a family disease, it really is.”</p><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p><p id=content-paragraph-7>She also confirmed that his two youngest daughters are aware that Bruce is ill. “We’re a very honest and open household. The most important thing was to be able for us to say what the disease was, explain what it is, because when you know what the disease is is from a medical standpoint, it sort of all makes sense,” Emma said. “So it was important that we let them know what it is. I don’t want there to be any stigma or shame attached to their dad’s diagnosis or for any form of dementia.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>Bruce has starred in countless cult classic films, including Armageddon&nbsp;and Pulp Fiction. He has also proved his comedic prowess in TV shows like Friends and That ’70s Show, among others. While he may be one of Hollywood’s most recognizable actors, another gig is worthy of attention: that of doting dad. The veteran actor is a father to five daughters, including Rumer, <strong>Tallulah</strong>, <strong>Scout</strong>, <strong>Mabel Ray</strong>, and <strong>Evelyn Penn</strong>.</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>The actor shares his adult children with former wife Demi, whom he was married to between 1987 and 2000, and his two youngest daughters with his current wife, Emma. The two wed in 2009. The blended family has a tight knit bond, <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>even quarantining together during</a> the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. On Father’s Day last year, Demi shared a snapshot of both families on Instagram and wrote, “Happy Father’s Day, Bruce! Your kids are so lucky to have you.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-12>Below is everything to know about the actor’s five daughters.</p><h2>Rumer Willis</h2><p id=content-paragraph-15>Rumer is Bruce and Demi’s oldest daughter and firstborn. Rumer followed in her famous parents’ footsteps and went into the world of acting. And her résumé is pretty notable: Rumer has starred in films including <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Once Upon a Time… in Hollywood</a>, Now and Then, House Bunny, Sorority Row, and Striptease (alongside her mom). Like her father, she has appeared on Broadway. Rumer made her theatrical debut as <strong>Roxie Hart</strong> in&nbsp;Chicago in 2015. The actress has also dabbled in modeling, having posed for campaigns for fashion designers <strong>Mark Badgley</strong> and <strong>James Mischka</strong>. She also won season 20 of <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Dancing with the Stars</a>&nbsp;in 2015.</p><p id=content-paragraph-16>As noted above, in Dec. 2022, Rumer revealed she is pregnant with her first baby. “Entering my hot kooky unhinged grandma era,” Demi captioned the re-post of the <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>snapshot</a>. After giving birth on April 18, 2023, Rumer said her baby was more than she and Derek “dreamed of.”</p><h2>Scout Willis</h2><p id=content-paragraph-19>Scout is Bruce and Demi’s middle child. Like her sisters, she has starred in a few films alongside her famous parents, including The Scarlet Letter, Bandits, and Breakfast of Champions. She has also dabbled in the music industry. She previously served as one half of the musical group Gus + Scout with musician <strong>Gus Wenner.&nbsp;</strong>They released an EP in 2012, titled&nbsp;Gus + Scout,&nbsp;consisting of five country rock folk ballads. Aside from performing with Gus, Scout has also performed on her own at venues in the past, including the <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Bootleg Theater in Los Angeles</a>. Like sister Tallulah, Scout briefly forayed into fashion in 2016, <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>launching a clothing line</a> called Scout’s General. Scout has been dating her boyfriend <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Jake Miller</strong></a> since at least 2018. Jake is a fellow music artist.</p><h2>Tallulah Willis</h2><p id=content-paragraph-22>Tallulah is the youngest daughter of Bruce and Demi. She is a mental health advocate and fashion designer, having launched her debut clothing brand Wyllis, which advocates for “connection, advocacy, and inclusion.” She also starred in a few films when she was younger, all of which featured her mom and/or dad in the title role, including The Scarlet Letter, The Whole Nine Yards, Bandits, and The Whole Ten Yards. Tallulah got engaged to <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Dillon Buss</strong></a> in May 2021 after a year of dating, but they secretly split one year later.</p><p id=content-paragraph-23>In May 2023, she penned an essay for <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Vogue</a> magazine on her dad’s dementia diagnosis. She also opened up about an <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>anorexia battle</a> and being diagnosed with borderline personality disorder.</p><h2>Mabel Ray Willis</h2><p id=content-paragraph-26>Mabel Ray is the eldest daughter and firstborn of Bruce and his current wife Emma. Her mom regularly shares sweet snapshots of her with her sister Evelyn, who can be seen holding up two American flags in Emma’s July 4 post this year (above). Judging from her mom’s Instagram page, Mabel Ray is a fan of <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>snuggling her younger sister</a> Evelyn Penn, <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>gazing through telescopes</a> with her famous dad, and bonding with her older stepsiblings. <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Emma recently shared a snapshot</a> of her two girls with their arms around Rumer, Tallulah, and Scout and captioned it, “Sisterhood is such a beautiful thing.”</p><h2>Evelyn Penn Willis</h2><p id=content-paragraph-29>Evelyn Penn is Bruce’s youngest daughter and second child with Emma. Like her sister, she has a close bond with her half-siblings. A scroll through her mom’s Instagram posts reveals that Evelyn is interested in sewing, <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>ice skating</a>, and <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>enjoying the great outdoors</a> with her family. For Father’s Day 2021, Emma shared a <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>sweet snapshot of Evelyn and sister</a> Mabel piling onto their dad on Instagram and gushed about her “girl dad” husband. “Bruce’s response when asked if he’d like to have a son? ‘I’d have 5 more girls right now.’ Happy Father’s Day to this proud #girldad.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme8GrrJydXay2rbjIrGSkoZSoenWBj21vbm1f</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fbruce-willis-kids-4504855.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fbruce-willis-kids-4504855.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fbruce-willis-kids-4504855.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fbruce-willis-kids-4504855.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fbruce-willis-kids-4504855.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fbruce-willis-kids-4504855.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./mason-mount-bio.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./mason-mount-bio.html>Mason Mount Bio [2023 Update]: Early Life &amp;amp; Clubs</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./celebrity-halloween-costumes-8-channing-tatum-your-boyfriend-can-be-20142610.html>Celebrity Halloween Costumes: 8 Channing Tatums Your Boyfriend Can Be</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./celebrity-halloween-costumes-8-channing-tatum-your-boyfriend-can-be-20142610.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
