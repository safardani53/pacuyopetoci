The debut album arrived on Friday (May 21), bringing a track that some fans think is essentially “drivers license” 2.0: “traitor.”&nbsp;As the song’s name states, the track is about a past lover who is now a “traitor” for taking only “two weeks” to date someone new.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>“You betrayed me / And I know that you’ll never feel sorry / For the way I hurt, yeah / You talked to her when we were together / Loved you at your worst but that didn’t matter / It took you two weeks to go off and date her / Guess you didn’t cheat, but you’re still a traitor,” Olivia sings in one verse. Given the emotionally-charged lyrics — and reference to a past lover and third person — fans couldn’t help but think of the rumored love triangle between Olivia, her High School Musical: The Musical: The Series&nbsp;co-star <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Joshua Bassett</strong></a> and fellow Disney star <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Sabrina Carpenter</strong></a> that “drivers license” turned into one of the biggest conspiracy theories of 2021.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Olivia's Traitor really felt like a nudge to the Joshua & Sabrina drama 👀👀 <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>#SOUROlivia</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-5>— Ian Sta Maria (@ianstamaria) <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>May 20, 2021</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-7>We must clarify, however, that it has never been confirmed if Olivia and Joshua actually dated. We must also point out that Olivia has dated her Bizaardvark co-star, <strong>Ethan Wacker</strong> (so, he could be a possible muse too). Regardless, after listening to someone break Olivia’s heart yet again on “traitor,” fans couldn’t help but think of her speculated romance with Joshua. Even the go-to website for lyric deciphering, <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Genius</a>, said that “traitor” is “a song possibly about Joshua Bassett&nbsp;and&nbsp;Sabrina Carpenter’s suspected relationship, and how Bassett is a ‘traitor’ to Olivia by moving on too fast from her.”</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>SHE CAME FOR JOSHUA IN TRAITOR GO OFF SIS</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>— steph :) (@foxybreadkick) <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>May 21, 2021</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-10>“If someone treated me like joshua bassett treated olivia rodrigo in the song traitor i’d be absolutely broken. god i love her album already EEEK,” one fan <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>tweeted</a>, while another wrote, “<span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0">Omg Joshua Bassett is shaking in his boots and I’m only on traitor!!! </span><span class=r-18u37iz>@Olivia_Rodrigo </span><span>is a lyrical genius!” Another fan <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>teased</a>, “joshua bassett gonna post the lyrics to traitor tomorrow like “this was my favorite on the album :) so proud of you liv x.”&nbsp;</span></p><p lang=en dir=ltr>omg listening to traitor joshua bassett really broke her heart</p><p id=content-paragraph-11>— 💋💋💋 (@hariborry) <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>May 21, 2021</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-13>Not everyone jumped to conclusions, though. “I really wanna know who broke her heart bc there’s no way that one man joshua did all this damage to my girl :(((,” one fan <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>tweeted</a>. Joshua’s name wasn’t just brought up in connection to “traitor,” though. Fans think the Disney star inspired many of the tracks — leading Joshua’s name to become a top trending topic on Twitter within an hour of&nbsp;Sour‘s release. More important than hypothetical relationship drama, though, was Olivia’s new music, which left fans in awe as they devoured other new tracks like “brutal” (which emerged as the fan-favorite) and “enough for you.”</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>olivia rodrigo after seeing joshua bassett move on with sabrina carpenter <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>#SOUR</a> <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>#SOUROlivia</a> <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>pic.twitter.com/Rh15mIAImR</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-14>— kayla (taylor’s version) (@kayla__dunne) <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>May 21, 2021</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-16>The past five months have been wild for Olivia. She’s turned 18. She released a juggernaut of a <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>song</a>, one that was a subject of a Saturday Night Live skit (months before she made <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>her SNL debut</a>). Olivia performed at the <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>2021 BRIT Awards</a> in London, where she was finally able to <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>meet</a> her <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>favorite songwriter</a>, <strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Taylor Swift.</a></strong>, On top of all that, she just dropped her debut album. Not bad for someone who is old enough to drive but still isn’t old enough to drink.</p><p id=content-paragraph-17>Ahead of Sour’s release, there was a little bit of viral chatter over a possible collaboration on the album. Olivia shared the songwriting and production credits, and fans noted that her song, “1 Step Forward, 3 Steps Back,” credited Taylor Swift and her longtime music partner, <strong>Jack Antonoff</strong>. While some wondered if this was a collab – the “1” and the “3” in the title was thought to be a subtle nod to “13,” Taylor’s favorite number – <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Rolling Stone</a> reported that the track was an “interpolations” of Swift’s “New Year’s Day.” Olivia said she was inspired by “Cruel Summer” when writing the bridge for “Deja Vu,” so this isn’t that surprising.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Olivia-Rodrigo-Joshua-Bassett-shutterstock-embed.jpg>Neither is Olivia’s success. It’s been five years since she was first introduced to the world as Paige Olvera on the Disney Channel series Bizaardvark, and two years after she landed the role of Nini Salazar-Roberts on Disney+’s High School Musical off-shoot. “I’ve always been on [TV] shows, doing something in the public eye,” she told <a href=# rel=nofollow>Nylon</a> magazine ahead of her album’s release, “but it’s really awesome, now, to be recognized for my music, something so much more indicative of who I really am as a person.” While Olivia’s initial brushes with fame came by playing other people, her music, and its success, has left her feeling “a lot more seen.” <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Olivia-Rodrigo-viral-momentm-shutterstock-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-19>“I feel really understood when people come up to me, and they’re like, “Oh, I love your song” because it’s an extension of my heart. It means so much more,” she added. During the chat, Olivia touched upon one of the viral elements of “Drivers License,” specifically the aforementioned <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>rumored</a> love triangle involving her, her HSM co-star Joshua and Sabrina. “I’m a super specific songwriter,” she said, citing how “broad storytelling just isn’t fun in art medium,” But, she said she’s also “gone back and made revisions to make it a little less specific because sometimes” because she feels that gossip and “drama” diminishes the song. Suddenly, people are talking about the real-world gossip behind the track and not the actual songwriting.</p><p id=content-paragraph-20>“I don’t take it personally, really. I understand. I completely understand. And you know, lots of times, it isn’t malicious,” Olivia said of gossip. “Most of the time, I guess. It’s none of my business. I write my songs, and people can say whatever they want to say about it. [They can] think whatever they want to think about my life, and that’s just part of it. It doesn’t really bother me. I also try to stay off of social media and not look at that stuff.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-21>“Drivers License” was released on Jan. 8, 2021, reaching no. 1 on Spotify, Apple Music, and Amazon Music chars. The song broke Spotify’s streaming records and debuted at the top of the Billboard Hot 100. It spent eight consecutive weeks. “Deja Vu,” the second single from Sour, didn’t replicate the success of “Drivers License,” but its debut at No. 8 on the Billboard Hot 100 was still impressive. “<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>good 4 u</a>,” the third single, continued both Olivia’s momentum and the pop-punk revival.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWphZH12e5FqZqikmau2onnRqJuroZekerW%2BwKKrqKpdorKiusinnmain6i1tq2Mm5isq5WpwW6%2Fzq6pZpmcl8Kuew%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2folivia-rodrigo-traitor-meaning-joshua-bassett-sour-album.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2folivia-rodrigo-traitor-meaning-joshua-bassett-sour-album.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2folivia-rodrigo-traitor-meaning-joshua-bassett-sour-album.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2folivia-rodrigo-traitor-meaning-joshua-bassett-sour-album.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2folivia-rodrigo-traitor-meaning-joshua-bassett-sour-album.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2folivia-rodrigo-traitor-meaning-joshua-bassett-sour-album.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./john-travolta-daughter-ella-birthday-disneyland-video.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./john-travolta-daughter-ella-birthday-disneyland-video.html>John Travoltas Daughter, Ella, Celebrates Her Birthday At Disneyland Hollywood Life</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./new-rizla-cards-menthol-cigarette-ban-slammed.html>Tobacco firms new Rizla cards to get round 2020 menthol cigarette ban slammed by charity The</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./new-rizla-cards-menthol-cigarette-ban-slammed.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
