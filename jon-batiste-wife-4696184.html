Jon has been a longstanding figure in the music industry, both putting out his own music, and collaborating with many other major acts over the years. Just before he won at the Grammys, he had announced that he and his wife&nbsp;<strong>Suleika Jaouad&nbsp;</strong>married in a private ceremony back in February. Suleika is a journalist and author, whose memoir&nbsp;Between Two Kingdoms chronicles her 2011 battle with cancer.&nbsp;Of course, Suleika cheered on her husband as he won all of his awards.

Suleika admitted that the pair had an immediate connection and had discussed marriage during their first week of their relationship in an April 3 interview with&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>CBS Sunday Morning</a>. “We have known that we wanted to get married from the first week that we started dating. That’s when Jon first brought up the topic of marriage to me,” she said.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>Jon has spoken about how Suleika has inspired his music. He admitted that “Show Me The Way” was about his relationship in a 2021 interview with&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>People.</a> “It speaks to a lot of me growing up and also our relationship,” he said. “It’s a beautiful thing to have that piece of our relationship sliced off into the album.”</p><h2><strong>The couple got married in February 2022.&nbsp;</strong></h2><p id=content-paragraph-5>The pair revealed that they’d gotten married in secret after Suleika was diagnosed with leukemia for a second time in February 2022 in the&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>CBS Sunday Morning</a>&nbsp;interview. Jon said that the pair planned to be strong in her <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>battle against cancer.</a> “This isn’t going to interrupt the plan that we have. We have a plan. We’re moving toward the plan, and this is just a bump in the road,” he told&nbsp;CBS.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>In the same interview, Suleika opened up about how Jon proposed, and how they planned their wedding last minute before she started receiving treatment. “We got married the day before I was admitted to the hospital to undergo my brain marrow transplant,” she said. “When I got my diagnosis, I’d planned this special birthday weekend, but it turned out Jon had multi-month plans in the making to propose to me, and when he did, he said to me, ‘I just want to be very clear: I’m not proposing to you because of this diagnosis. It took me a year to design your ring.'” She also said that Jon told her that her battle wouldn’t affect his love for her or their marriage plans. “This diagnosis doesn’t change anything. It just makes it all the clearer to me that I want to commit to this and for us to be together,” he told her.</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>Suleika went on to explain how the pair had a rushed wedding with a small ceremony with just four people attending, and they bought their wedding clothes the night before. She said that the beautiful, intimate ceremony gave them so much hope as she got a bone marrow transplant. “We were so happy. So brimming with love and positivity from this beautiful evening that we’d had, and I really believed that that carried us through. That sense of community. That sense of love. That sense of joy and spontaneity were so important,” she said.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Jon-Batiste-Suleika-Jaouad-embed2.jpg><h2><strong>Suleika is a journalist.</strong></h2><p id=content-paragraph-8>Suleika has a number of creative projects, but primarily, she’s a writer. Her work has been published in a number of different outlets. She’s written about her battle with cancer for&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Vogue</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The Atlantic,</a>&nbsp;and she’s even given a <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>TedTalk</a> about her battle. Other than that, she’s also written about prison, including an <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>op-ed</a> on the death row inmate&nbsp;<strong>Quinton Jones&nbsp;</strong>for&nbsp;T<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>he New York Times</a><a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>.&nbsp;</a></p><h2><strong>Suleika was diagnosed with cancer in 2011.</strong></h2><p id=content-paragraph-9>While Suleika went into treatment for leukemia for the second time in February 2022, this isn’t the first time that she’s fought against cancer. She was diagnosed with leukemia for the first time after she graduated college, and she chronicled her battle with disease and her journey towards recovery in her 2021 book&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Between Two Worlds: A Memoir Of A Life Interrupted</a>.&nbsp;The memoir chronicles a 100 day road trip Suleika took after she beat cancer for the first time, where she met with some of the people that she exchanged letters with when she first fought against leukemia. “What she learned on this trip is that the divide between sick and well is porous, that the vast majority of us will travel back and forth between these realms throughout our lives,” the book’s description sttates.</p><h2><strong>She’s been painting through her second battle with leukemia</strong></h2><p id=content-paragraph-10>As she battles cancer for the second time, Suleika announced her creative “<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>100-day project</a>” where she’s planning on creating a beautiful painting over 100 days. “I know from experience how powerful the 100-day project can be, both the sense of creative possibility and the organizing principle it affords: your day becomes centered around making one tiny beautiful thing,” she wrote in an <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram post</a> about the new project. She’s also shared some <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>photos</a> of her paintings on her Instagram as well as <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>photos</a> of her creating the beautiful artwork from her hospital bed.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme8mopWaakam2tMDEZq6inpVigXeFlWpvbWc%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fjon-batiste-wife-4696184.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fjon-batiste-wife-4696184.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fjon-batiste-wife-4696184.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fjon-batiste-wife-4696184.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fjon-batiste-wife-4696184.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fjon-batiste-wife-4696184.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./kimber-james-19880402-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./kimber-james-19880402-html.html>Kimber James (Movie Actress) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./who-is-peewee-longway-dating.html>Who is Peewee Longway Dating Now</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./who-is-peewee-longway-dating.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
