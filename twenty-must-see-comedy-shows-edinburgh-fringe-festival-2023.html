Did it work? Did it f***. This show isn't about mental health, this show is mental health. In all it's rage, joy, tears, anxiety and humour. Isn't that what comedy is? There's even a bit where I'm pretty scathing of the disingenuous platitudes of the modern wellness industry.”</p><p>John Robins is one of his generation’s most critically acclaimed stand-ups. John followed winning the Edinburgh Comedy Award (formerly The Perrier Award) in 2017 with two sold out national tours: The Darkness of Robins and Hot Shame. John is also a recipient of the Gold Aria Award (formerly The Sony Awards) for the BBC Radio 5 Live radio show, unsurprisingly he’s one of the leading voices calling to make it illegal for awards to change their sponsor.</p><p>Venue: Just the Tonic Nucleus - Just the Tonic's Atomic Room<br>Time: 20:50<br>Dates: 3 – 27 Aug (not 7, 14, 21)</p><p><strong>Mythos: Ragnarök</strong></p><p>A ‘Must See Show’ of last years Fringe, Mythos: Ragnarök, will be returning to Edinburgh Fringe bringing their ground-breaking show to more audiences than ever.</p><p>This revolutionary show sees Odin and Loki in their struggle to overcome primeval giants, rival Gods and Goddesses, and each another’s ambitions in this dark comic adaption of Norse mythology.</p><p>The cast dexterously weave ancient myths, legends, and folk tales into original pieces of theatre, in a way that has never been seen before. As actors who specialise in professional wrestling, they create some of the most intense and thrilling fight scenes ever seen in a theatrical setting, which gain equal praise from lifelong wrestling fans and those with no interest in it whatsoever.</p><p>Venue: Assembly Roxy<br>Time: 21:20<br>Dates: 2 – 27 August</p><p><strong>Adam Riches: The Guy Who... and Adam Riches: Dungeons 'N B******s</strong></p><p>20 years since treading the boards of the Edinburgh Fringe Festival for the first time, critically acclaimed comedian Adam Riches, will return to this year’s Fringe with not one, but two shows!</p><p>The Guys Who… is the eagerly anticipated sequel to Adam’s ground-breaking show The Guy Who…. Once again, Riches masterfully embodies the ‘nice-guy’, faux-woke, sleazy, manipulative persona that nowadays seems to be, well, everywhere. Thanks to Riches’ imperious ability to inhabit any part to a T, this character-driven comic satire will make audiences laugh and rethink about ‘the guys who’ they might have encountered (or even been!) in their lives. Fair warning: Adam Riches will not be held liable for any possible breakups that happen because of his show…</p><p>Secondly Dungeons’N B******s invites you to join Lord Sean of House Bean as he lures you deep into his dungeon lair. If this doesn’t sound ominous enough, he will then be challenging you to a series of quests, questions and quaudience "quinteractions", in order to win the ultimate prize. Think Pat Sharp’s Funhouse meets Krull in the show TV commissioners will soon be calling ‘a hard pass’. Trigger warning – may contain triggers (of the crossbow variety).</p><p>Show: The Guys Who…<br>Venue: Underbelly, Cowgate Cow Cafe<br>Time: 14:10<br>Dates: 3 to 27 August</p><p>Show: Dungeons ‘n B******s<br>Venue: Monkey Barrel 4<br>Time: 22:40<br>Dates: 17 to 27 August</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p><strong>Buy tickets for Edinburgh Fringe Festival shows <a href=# aria-label="here (opens in a new tab)" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">here</a></strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/fringe3.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/fringe2.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jq2taGpiaoJ4gJRvZq2vlaPBunnMrqqtZaOasm6vzqacnbFdqLWww9JmnJ2hnpfCs7PHZp2roZ6csm6yxKyroq6RoXpzfJFsZg%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ftwenty-must-see-comedy-shows-edinburgh-fringe-festival-2023.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2ftwenty-must-see-comedy-shows-edinburgh-fringe-festival-2023.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2ftwenty-must-see-comedy-shows-edinburgh-fringe-festival-2023.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2ftwenty-must-see-comedy-shows-edinburgh-fringe-festival-2023.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ftwenty-must-see-comedy-shows-edinburgh-fringe-festival-2023.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2ftwenty-must-see-comedy-shows-edinburgh-fringe-festival-2023.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./who-is-dawn-morante-dating.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./who-is-dawn-morante-dating.html>Who is Dawn Morante Dating Now</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./reading-leeds-festivals-2018-tickets-line-up-dates-headlining-kings-of-leon-full-list.html>Reading and Leeds Festivals 2018 - line-up, dates and who is headlining with Kings Of Leon</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./reading-leeds-festivals-2018-tickets-line-up-dates-headlining-kings-of-leon-full-list.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
