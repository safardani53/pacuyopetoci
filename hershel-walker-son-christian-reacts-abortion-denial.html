The allegation has received huge media attention because Herschel has <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>taken a hard stance</a> against abortion, saying in his campaign that if elected, he supports a total ban on abortion, with no exceptions–not even to spare the pregnant woman’s life. Christian, who was previously the only acknowledged son of Walker and his ex-wife <strong>Cindy DeAngelis Grossman</strong>, (whom Herschel divorced in 2002,) is an emerging influencer and podcaster with 281K Twitter followers. His father Herschel was found to have fathered three other children, after a Daily Beast report in June exposed the Republican senate hopeful from Georgia as having a 2014 paternity suit against him for a now 10-year-old son. According to a statement given June 15 by Herschel to the outlet, he also has two other children, bringing the total to four — Christian was previously unaware of his siblings. However, on October 6, yet another <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Daily Beast </a>report emerged that the woman involved in the abortion reports had a child after becoming pregnant by Hershel again, giving birth to one of four known children by the former athlete. The same woman then spoke to <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The New York Times</a> on October 7, claiming that Herschel urged her to have a second abortion. She refused, and the child is now 10 years old.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>After the published report about the alleged abortion, Christian took to his Twitter to lambast his father about his morality. “I don’t care about someone who has a bad past and takes accountability,” Christian wrote via Twitter on Monday, October 3, within hours of the report’s publication. “But how DARE YOU LIE and act as though you’re some ‘moral, Christian, upright man.’ You’ve lived a life of DESTROYING other peoples lives. How dare you.” He then followed up the tweets on Tuesday, October 4, with a couple of video tweets. “I’ve stayed silent for nearly two years as my whole life has been lied about publicly,” Christian captioned the first video, seemingly clapping back at trolls. “I did ONE campaign event, then said I didn’t want involvement. Don’t you dare test my authenticity.”</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>I don’t care about someone who has a bad past and takes accountability.

Now they’re blaming me for everything I’m not responsible for. It’s disgusting,” he tweeted on October 4.</p><p id=content-paragraph-11>The explosive tweets come after The Daily Beast reported on Monday that the former NFL great and Republican candidate for senate in Georgia allegedly paid $700 in a reimbursement check to an ex-girlfriend in order to pay for an abortion and related expenses. The unnamed woman told the outlet that the outspoken <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>anti-abortion</a> politician “urged” her to get an abortion and backed up her claims with a bank deposit receipt with an image of the 2009 check and a “get well” card, allegedly from the controversial Republican. Herschel denied the report in a statement issued via Twitter, calling it a “flat-out lie” and completely refuting it in what he called “the strongest possible terms.” Herschel also threated to sue The Daily Beast for the “defamatory lie.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-12>&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Hershel-Walker-son-Christian-abortion-ss-post.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-13>Despite the fact that it’s getting a lot of attention, it’s still unclear how this will affect his campaign against sitting Senator <strong>Raphael Warnock</strong>, a self-described “pro-choice pastor” who has two children of his own with ex-wife <strong>Oulèye Ndoye</strong> and has remained scandal-free throughout the campaign. Warnock currently leads Walker by five points in <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>at least one poll. </a><span>It’s still unclear whether the recent news involving the alleged abortion will boost Democrat Warnock, or if this will remain a tight race.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpiZH5xe49tZqGdoqi1priMsJilo5WnerS7zWaaoaqZqMGqrc1mqZ6Zk6nAbq3BqKmtoZ%2BjeqWxzaKYpWc%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fhershel-walker-son-christian-reacts-abortion-denial.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fhershel-walker-son-christian-reacts-abortion-denial.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fhershel-walker-son-christian-reacts-abortion-denial.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fhershel-walker-son-christian-reacts-abortion-denial.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fhershel-walker-son-christian-reacts-abortion-denial.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fhershel-walker-son-christian-reacts-abortion-denial.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./terrorist-daniel-khalife-jail-kitchen.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./terrorist-daniel-khalife-jail-kitchen.html>Inside terrorist Daniel Khalifes jailbreak 'straight out of WW2 film' with him hanging from</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./denise-richards-and-charlie-sheen-clash-over-daughter-sami-sheens-onlyfans.html>Denise Richards and Charlie Sheen Clash Over Daughter Sami Sheen's OnlyFans</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./denise-richards-and-charlie-sheen-clash-over-daughter-sami-sheens-onlyfans.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
