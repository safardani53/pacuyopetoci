It makes the prison service look like a laughing stock.</p><p>“It is utterly ridiculous he managed to escape so easily with such a basic old-fashioned ploy. Escaping by clinging to the underside of a van is the sort of thing you see in old World War Two films.”</p><p><a href=#>Tory</a> MP Paul Maynard, who sits on the Justice Select Committee, said: “Whilst the focus right now should clearly be on tracking down this individual, there must be serious questions asked in the near term about how a person accused of acts prejudicial to national security could be permitted to escape.”</p><p>Ian Acheson, former head of security at <a href=#>Wandsworth</a>, added: “This is incredibly serious. An escape from custody, as this appears to be, would have to defeat multiple layers of physical/human security. We must know what’s happened.”</p><p>The ex-soldier, who was based at <a href=#>Beacon Barracks</a>, <a href=#>Staffs</a>, is accused of breaking the <a href=#>Official Secrets Act</a> and acting against the “safety and interests of the State”.</p><p>He allegedly collected information, notes and documents which might be “useful to the enemy”. It is also said he took details from <a href=#>MoD</a> files “useful to a person committing or preparing an act of terrorism”.</p><p>Khalife is also accused of a bomb hoax, by allegedly leaving “three canisters with wires” on a desk at RAF Stafford on January 2.</p><p>He was discharged from the Army in April and was due to stand trial on November 20.</p><p>A bail application had been refused.</p><p>He was initially held at top-security <a href=#>Belmarsh</a> in South East London, before a move to Wandsworth, a Category B Victorian jail.</p><p>He was working on C Wing, which houses vulnerable cons like sex offenders.</p><p>The Prison Service said: “We are working with the Metropolitan Police to recapture this prisoner and are urgently investigating how he escaped.”</p><p>Do you know more?
