On September 25, Joe and Sophie <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>came to a legal agreement</a> that says their children have to live in New York for the time being.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>Here is everything you need to know about Joe and Sophie’s two daughters.</p><h2>Joe Jonas & Sophie Turner’s Daughter, Willa</h2><p id=content-paragraph-7>It was first revealed that Joe and <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>his wife</a> were expecting their <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>first child together</a> in Feb. 2020. At the time, a source close to the couple told&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Just Jared</a>, “The couple is keeping things very hush-hush, but their friends and family are super excited for them.” A second source told the outlet that, “Sophie has decidedly been choosing outfits to wear on and off the carpet to accommodate her changing body.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-8><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Joe and Sophie</a> have always been extremely private when it comes to <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>their children</a>, as they never post photos of their faces online.</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>The former power couple shocked fans everywhere when they <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>announced their split</a> in September 2023, four years after they exchanged vows.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><h2>Joe & Sophie’s Second Daughter</h2><p id=content-paragraph-12>Willa officially became a big sister when <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Sophie gave birth</a> to her and Joe’s second daughter on July 14, 2022. Although her name has not been publicly revealed, the former couple were proud to walk around with <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>both of their girls</a> in New York City after their second baby’s arrival.</p><p id=content-paragraph-13>Sophie&nbsp;confirmed she <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>was pregnant</a> with their second daughter, by cradling her <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>baby bump</a> for the cover of&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>ELLE UK</a>, for the June 2022 issue.</p><p id=content-paragraph-14>“It’s what life is about for me – raising the next generation,” she told the outlet at the time. “The greatest thing in life is seeing my daughter go from strength to strength. We’re so excited to be expanding the family. It’s the best blessing ever.”</p><h2>What Joe Has Said About Being A Dad</h2><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p><p id=content-paragraph-15>Following the arrival of his daughter, Willa, Joe spoke with&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>CBS This Morning</a>&nbsp;in early 2022, about being a dad.</p><p id=content-paragraph-16>“It’s been amazing,” he said of being quarantined at home with Sophie and his daughter. “It’s been forced time at home. To be in one place for a solid amount of time and be with my family… my immediate family is time I don’t think I’ll get back.” After he called his eldest daughter “gorgeous” he also revealed that one lesson he learned since <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>becoming a dad</a> is that, “naps are nice.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-19>Later, in Aug. 2022, the “Sucker” singer told <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>PEOPLE&nbsp;</a>that it took some time to learn how to balance his career and having kids.</p><p id=content-paragraph-20>“It’s an adjustment period,” he said at the time. “Just something that I’m learning as I go, I think I can now work a little bit harder to take time off. I’m still trying to figure it out. Some weeks are a little bit more challenging than others, but it makes it a lot easier when you enjoy your gig … I wake up every day just thrilled to be able to go make music or act and create different projects and have a beautiful family, so it feels like a dream come true.”</p><h2>Joe and Sophie’s Custody Drama</h2><p id=content-paragraph-21>Joe and Sophie’s <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>divorce drama</a> spilled into the custody over their two kids. On September 21, Sophie <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>filed a lawsuit</a> against Joe in Manhattan for “the immediate return of children wrongfully removed or wrongfully retained.” In the court documents, Sophie claimed that she and Joe agreed over Christmas 2022 to move to her home country, England. Sophie alleged that Joe would not hand over their kids’ passports when she wanted to take them to the U.K., which prompted her to sue him.</p><p id=content-paragraph-22>Joe <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>responded to the lawsuit</a> via his rep with a statement given to&nbsp;<strong>HollywoodLife </strong>on September 21. The rep said that Joe and Sophie “had a cordial meeting this past Sunday in New York, when Sophie came to New York to be with the kids” and that “Joe’s impression of the meeting was that they had reached an understanding that they would work together towards an amicable coparenting setup.” The rep added, “This is an unfortunate legal disagreement about a marriage that is sadly ending. When language like ‘abduction’ is used, it is misleading at best, and a serious abuse of the legal system at worst.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-23>On September 25, the former couple signed an interim order that agreed to keep their two daughters in New York, according to court documents obtained by<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> People</a>. The kids reportedly have to stay in the Southern and Eastern districts of New York, which includes New York City, Long Island and the Hudson Valley.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme8monGain6OutHnKopusZWVlhHF9kmtm</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fjoe-jonas-kids-5070132.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fjoe-jonas-kids-5070132.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fjoe-jonas-kids-5070132.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fjoe-jonas-kids-5070132.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fjoe-jonas-kids-5070132.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fjoe-jonas-kids-5070132.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./netflix-shows-most-sex-scenes-orange-new-black-mirror.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./netflix-shows-most-sex-scenes-orange-new-black-mirror.html>The Netflix shows with the most sex - from Orange is the New Black's 44 steamy scenes to Black Mirro</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./lil-moe-6blocka-ky5h-html.html>Lil Moe 6Blocka (Rapper) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./lil-moe-6blocka-ky5h-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
