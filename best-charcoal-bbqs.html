A charcoal barbecue can help you make the most of your garden this summer.</p><p>The best charcoal BBQs will help you to cook delicious char-grilled meat and vegetables from the comfort of your own back yard.</p><p>If you're wondering whether to go for a charcoal or gas BBQ, there are advantages to both.</p><p>Charcoal BBQs are generally cheaper to buy than gas but it can be more hassle trying to get a fire going, whereas with gas, you simply just turn it on.</p><p>But many would argue that for an authentic BBQ taste, charcoal is the only way. Charcoal can reach higher temperatures and the smoke from the coals creates that delicious smoky flavour.</p><p>Read on for our round-up of the best charcoal BBQs for 2023 - including the best brands, dual gas and charcoal hybrids and lightweight portable options.</p><p>Looking for gas BBQ recommendations? Check out our roundup of the <a href=# rel=noopener>best gas barbecues.</a></p><h2>Best charcoal BBQs at a glance:</h2><h2>Texas Round Portable BBQ</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static.thcdn.com/images/large/webp//productimg/1600/1600/14005794-1305014611862176.jpg><ul><li><strong>Texas Round Portable BBQ, £20 (saving £5) from Homebase - <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">buy here</a></strong></li></ul><p>At just £20 in the Homebase sale, this snazzy red Texas portable BBQ is an absolute steal.</p><p>Admittedly, it is rather rudimentary; it's portable, meaning there's no stand, and there's no storage space either.</p><p>However, it's extremely lightweight, and there's a cooking area of 34cm, which is enough to cook for 3 or 4 people.</p><p>There's also an air vent to control airflow, a wire stand to prevent damaging grass, and a lock/buckle system for ease of transportation.</p><p><strong>Dimensions: </strong>29 x 36 x 36cm <strong>Cooking area:&nbsp;</strong>34cm diameter <strong>Fuel:</strong> Charcoal</p><h2>Weber Master-Touch Charcoal Grill</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/weber-charcoal-bbq.jpg><ul><li><strong>Master-Touch GBS Premium E-5770 Charcoal Barbecue 57cm, £399 from Weber - <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">buy here</a></strong></li></ul><p><strong>Pros: </strong>Generous grill size, good temperature control, easy to use, 10 year warranty</p><p><strong>Cons: </strong>None!</p><p>Whether you're already a barbecue master or are looking to hone your skills, the Master-Touch charcoal barbecue won't disappoint.</p><p>We tested out this kettle barbecue over the summer and were seriously impressed.</p><p>It's easy to use, has a fantastic design and honestly, we have nothing bad to say about it - it practically does everything perfectly.</p><p>It's a grill and a smoker in one, has a range of practical features such as a hinged lid, one-touch cleaning system and temperature gauge, and the quality is top-notch. Weber offers a warranty of up to 10 years on its charcoal grills, which is a testament to this.</p><p>The wheels on the bottom make it easy to manoeuvre, we found it simple to control the temperature via the ducts, and the ash catcher made clean up quicker than ever.</p><p>Size-wise, it's ideal for families and for parties as you can grill up to 13 burger patties at once.</p><p>We cooked for two people a couple of times, and although it's probably slightly too large for that, it still produced excellent results.</p><p>Overall, we'd highly recommend it as a quality option.</p><p><strong>Dimensions:&nbsp;</strong>100cm H x 65cm W x 76cm D <strong>Cooking area:&nbsp;</strong>2342 cm² <strong>Fuel:</strong> Charcoal</p><p><strong>READ MORE:</strong></p><h2><span class=base data-ui-id=page-title-wrapper>Flamemaster Portable Barrel Charcoal BBQ</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/m.media-amazon.com/images/W/IMAGERENDERING_521856-T1/images/I/51ERD9e77LL._AC_SL1200_.jpg><ul><li class=page-title><strong><span class=base data-ui-id=page-title-wrapper>Flamemaster Portable Barrel Charcoal BBQ - Stainless steel, £54.99 at Robert Dyas - <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">buy here</a></span></strong></li></ul><p>We love the retro look of this compact barrel BBQ from Flamemaster</p><p>Made from strong, sturdy stainless steel and with a carry handle and lockable hood, it's super easy to transport and ideal to take with you on camping trips, picnics and more.</p><p>There are two cooking grills and it opens out flat to give you plenty of cooking space. Simply add charcoal and you're good to start cooking some delicious BBQ food.</p><p><strong>Dimensions:</strong>D 42 x W 25 x H 38cm&nbsp;<strong>Cooking area:</strong>32 x 22cm&nbsp;<strong>Fuel:</strong> Charcoal</p><h2>Char-Broil Gas2Coal 2.0 two burner hybrid barbecue<img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Char-Broil-NEW-for-2021-Gas2Coal-2-burner-369.99-e1626267885381.png></h2><ul><li><strong>Char-Broil Gas2Coal 2.0, £386.10 from Appliances Direct - <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">buy here</a></strong></li></ul><p><strong>Pros: </strong>Dual fuel flexibility, charcoal heats up quickly, great tasting smoky flavour</p><p><strong>Cons: </strong>Expensive</p><p>The Char-Broil Gas2Coal 2.0 is a hybrid barbecue that combines the power of gas and charcoal in one setup.</p><p>The beauty of this option is that it combines the best features of both types of barbecues and you can use either fuel depending on what you fancy, or what’s available.</p><p>Gas mode is pretty straightforward: you just turn on the gas and press the electric igniter to get the fire going.</p><p>In charcoal mode, you use the gas to get the charcoal going so there’s no waiting around or faffing with scrunched-up newspaper. And, once your coal is ready, you switch off the gas and use the charcoal to get all the flavour that’s hard to achieve on a gas barbecue.</p><p>When we tested it, we found the barbecue was easy to use - the coals were ready in about 20 minutes - and the results were incredible.</p><p>Thanks to the gas lighting process, there were no false starts associated with your typical charcoal barbecue. And the grill was seriously hot, which meant that our food cooked quickly, evenly and without burning.</p><p>We were especially impressed with the porcelain-enamelled cast iron grills, which produced restaurant-quality grill lines and were easy to clean up afterwards.</p><p>It’s obviously a bit pricier than your standard charcoal grill, but if you’re looking for a premium barbecue that not only looks good but delivers results, we couldn’t recommend it enough.</p><p><strong>Dimensions:&nbsp;</strong>118cm H x 114cm W x 66cm D <strong>Cooking area: </strong>1771&nbsp;cm² <strong>Fuel:</strong> Charcoal and gas</p><h2>Valiant FIR551 folding portable picnic barbecue</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/81E2rLtZaL._AC_SL1500_.jpg><ul><li><strong>Valiant folding portable picnic barbecue, £44.99 from Amazon - <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">buy here</a></strong></li></ul><p>If you’re cooking for a smaller group at the park, beach &nbsp;- or in your own back garden - this portable BBQ is a great option.</p><p>It opens up to a 32cm x 23cm cooking surface, which will fit more than a couple of burgers and sausages.</p><p>Plus, it's raised off the ground so won't leave any scorch marks on the ground - whether you're using it on decking, your garden lawn or out and about.</p><p>And once you’re done, it folds up into a neat suitcase that weighs just 3.3kg.</p><p>One happy reviewer said, "I love this little bbq! It's ideal for our family of three. The cooking area is about the same size as a standard disposable one.

Use the brush with the metal bristles to remove any stuck-on food debris and grime and then wash off any grease with warm water and washing up liquid like you would with an oven shelf.</p><p>If there are any stuck-on bits, soak the grill in some warm soapy water to loosen these before you brush them off.</p><p>To clean the base and the lid, you use a wooden brush to brush away any deposits of ash.
