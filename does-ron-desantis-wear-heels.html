He has signed bills into law that ban abortion after six weeks, prohibit the word gay from being used in classrooms of children through third grade, prevent pronouns from being used in schools, and removed state and federal funding for diversity programs. Don't worry, this is just the horrifying tip of the hate iceberg.</p><p>When he's not carving Florida into one of the most conservative states in the union, DeSantis is running for president so he can bring his bigotry and prejudice to the entire country. No thanks, we're good! I'm not a fan of ridiculing a person's physical appearance, especially when there are so many other things to condemn, but fashion choices are a free-for-all. Eagle-eyed folks on social media have noticed DeSantis's odd footwear while on the campaign trail. Is he wearing heels?</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Does Ron DeSantis wearing heels? Sure looks like it.</h2><p>On Oct. 5, 2023, Anthony Oliveira <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">retweeted a photo of Ron DeSantis</a> while he was in Tampa drumming up endorsements from Florida sheriffs.</p><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Anthony's website</a>, Anthony is "a three-time National Magazine and two-time GLAAD award-winning author, film programmer, pop culture critic, and PhD living in Toronto." He is also a shrewd observer of footwear. In other words, Anthony is boot astute.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>In the picture, a red-faced DeSantis is sandwiched between a plastic podium and various members of law enforcement, but that's not what caught Anthony's eye. He zoomed in on DeSantis's shoes, and broke down what was going on with them physically. It's quite telling.</p><p>"Some of you are confused about the foot situation but the short guy code does not apply to Nazis," he said referring to what is clearly a pair of boots. "This man is wearing the cheapest secret heels on the market and the front is curling because heâ€™s gone too ambitious and the whole front is empty." It's as if the tip of DeSantis's boots are folding into themselves, such is the strength of their cringe.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>DeSantis is undoubtedly trying to make himself look taller because with great height, comes the perceived sense of power. Just ask any dating app bio; height matters. Scientifically this may also be true as the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">National Library of Medicine</a> reported that "across cultures, taller stature is linked to increased social status." The theory behind this is being tall is associated with better health and greater strength.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Some folks referred to DeSantis's heels as gender-affirming care.</h2><p>A couple of people replied to Anthony's tweet and said DeSantis's heels were gender-affirming care, and they are not far from the truth. Nowadays we tend to equate heels with women but they were "first invented in Persia in the 10th century, and they were originally designed for men," per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Fast Company</a>.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Valerie Steel, director of The Museum at the Fashion Institute of Technology, told the outlet, "Wealthy men wore them to give them additional height, and when they rode on horseback, the heels clicked into the stirrups." Soon, this trend spread all over Europe and the 17th century was looking a bit bigger.</p><p>When women began wearing heels in order to gain status of their own, it didn't take long for men to sexualize them. Evidently "heels began to be associated with female eroticism," said Valerie. Once this occurred, men opted for a flat boot to distinguish themselves from women. Fast-forward to today, where Ron DeSantis is bringing the heel's original intention back: an ego and height boost.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfmbymv4yrpqdllJrAorrToqpmr5WWv260xJ6jrA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fdoes-ron-desantis-wear-heels.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fdoes-ron-desantis-wear-heels.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fdoes-ron-desantis-wear-heels.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fdoes-ron-desantis-wear-heels.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fdoes-ron-desantis-wear-heels.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fdoes-ron-desantis-wear-heels.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./england-under-17s-world-cup-defeat-uzbekistan.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./england-under-17s-world-cup-defeat-uzbekistan.html>England Under-17s CRASH OUT of World Cup after shock 2-1 defeat to Uzbekistan as fans say the fut</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./beauty-pie-review.html>Beauty Pie review: Save 50% with our code</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./beauty-pie-review.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
