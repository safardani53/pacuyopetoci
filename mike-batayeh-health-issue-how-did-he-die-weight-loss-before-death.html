<time>01 Jan 0001, 00:00</time></div></div><p><strong>As the Breaking Bad actor died at the age of 52,</strong> allegations about Mike Batayeh’s weight loss have been spreading on the internet. Was the star’s death caused by weight loss? Mike Batayeh was born in Detroit but spent most of his life in Los Angeles, where he died.&nbsp;He has appeared as a guest and recurrent actor on various television shows, including Everybody Loves Raymond, Sleeper Cell, Touch, and Breaking Bad. Along with his key role in Detroit Unleaded, he also appeared in American Dreams, Gas, American East, Don’t Mess With The Zohan, and American Dreams.</p><p>Mike has headlined and performed at prominent comedy clubs around the country, including Gotham in New York City and the Laugh Factory (regular), Comedy Store, Improv, and Icehouse in Los Angeles. He was among the first Western comedians to play for Middle Eastern audiences in locations such as Dubai.&nbsp;He filmed a comedy special for Showtime Arabia, Egypt, Lebanon, and Jordan, where he was invited twice by the royal family to the Amman International Comedy Festival and Nazareth.</p><h2>Mike Batayeh Loses Weight Before Death</h2><p>Many people have speculated about actor Mike’s weight reduction before his death. Official reports, however, do not indicate that Batayeh lost weight.&nbsp;According to reports, the Breaking Bad actor suffered from stress and despair. As a result, we may assume that this may have contributed to his weight reduction. However, neither the celebrity nor his close friends mentioned the weight loss.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Mike-Batayeh-1.jpg alt="Mike Batayeh" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Mike did not have any cardiac problems, according to the actor’s sister. However, he died in his sleep at his home in Michigan, United States.&nbsp;Batayeh, a native of Detroit who lived in Los Angeles, is survived by five sisters and several nieces and nephews.&nbsp;His management confirmed to The Post that a memorial ceremony would be held on June 16 in Plymouth, Michigan.</p><p>“He will be greatly missed by those who loved him and his great ability to bring laughter and joy to so many,” his family said in a statement to TMZ earlier this week.&nbsp;From 2011 to 2012, Batayeh appeared in three episodes of AMC’s “Breaking Bad,” as Markowski, the manager of Lavandera Brillante, an industrial laundry run by drug kingpin Gus Fring.</p><h2>Mike Batayeh’s Illness And Health Problems: How Did The Breaking Bad Star Pass Away?</h2><p>The family of actor Mike Batayeh revealed to The Washington Post that Batayeh died unexpectedly from a heart attack while sleeping and had no previous history of cardiac issues.&nbsp;The cause of death, however, was eventually judged to be “asphyxia hanging.” The “Breaking Bad” star died on June 1 at his home in Michigan. A representative for the Washtenaw County Medical Examiner’s Office confirmed to The Post via email that the 52-year-old performer died as a result of blood vessels or air channels in the neck shutting due to external pressure.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Mike-Batayeh-2.jpg alt="Mike Batayeh" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Stress may have had a role in Mike’s tragedy. ‘Hormones like cortisol and adrenaline are generated while under stress.&nbsp;According to research, continuous stress leads the body to create a lot of cortisol, which raises blood pressure, triglycerides, sugar, and cholesterol levels.&nbsp;According to Dr. Pravin Kahale, a specialist in cardiology at the Kokilaben Dhirubhai Ambani Hospital in Mumbai, stress may modify arterial plaque, which is significant since it can affect the heart and create overall wear and tear on the body.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGikoqOVYq%2BiwMCynKFlmJqurcDHZqCsq6Waeqm71mabopxdnbJusMieZLCdmZy1tXnLqKqsZZKas7C%2BxGabnpmknXw%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fmike-batayeh-health-issue-how-did-he-die-weight-loss-before-death.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fmike-batayeh-health-issue-how-did-he-die-weight-loss-before-death.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fmike-batayeh-health-issue-how-did-he-die-weight-loss-before-death.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fmike-batayeh-health-issue-how-did-he-die-weight-loss-before-death.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fmike-batayeh-health-issue-how-did-he-die-weight-loss-before-death.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fmike-batayeh-health-issue-how-did-he-die-weight-loss-before-death.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./north-devon-tourism-ilfracombe-attacked-in-review.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./north-devon-tourism-ilfracombe-attacked-in-review.html>Our town has been blasted as 'snooty' &amp;amp; filled with obnoxious youngsters who take too many selfies..</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./victoria-justice-dating-boyfriend-ryan-rottman-zac-efron.html>Meet Victoria Justice's New Older Man, Ryan Rottman He's BFFs With Zac Efron!
