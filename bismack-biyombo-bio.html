at the club for two years.</p><p>Following impressive performances for the team, Bismack decided to move to Fuenlabrada, where he would attract interest from NBA scouts.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/biyombo-231.jpg><p>Subsequently, the Congolese got invited to play in the 2011 Nike Hoops Summit, a competition where the top high school seniors from the U.S are pitted against top international teens.</p><p>Other people would have been satisfied just with the call-up but not Biyombo.</p><p>In a display of his raw talent, the future Hornets center recorded a triple-double with 10 blocks, 11 rebounds, and 12 points, playing against the likes of now-LA Lakers All-Star <a href=#><strong>Anthony Davis</strong></a>.</p><p>As a result, NBA general managers and scouts who came to watch the game were extremely impressed.</p><p>Right after the game, Bismack stated,- “It gave me a chance to introduce myself to the NBA world and see if I could&nbsp;be drafted in the next year or two.”</p><p>Biyombo’s dream came true in the subsequent 2011 NBA Draft as he was drafted 7th overall by the Sacramento Kings before trading the Congo native’s rights to Charlotte Bobcats (now Charlotte Hornets).</p><p>Previously, when the Bobcats center was still a child back home in Congo, Biyombo did not have money to buy a pair of shoes.</p><p>However, shoes were no longer a problem for young Bismack as he earned <strong>$2.7 million</strong> in his first year with the Charlotte-based franchise.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/biyombo-232.jpg><p>After the draft, expectations were extremely high for the Congolese as he was a lottery pick.</p><p>Unfortunately, the Bobcats center could never live up to the potential as he never averaged double figures in points, rebounds, and blocks.</p><p>To illustrate, the best year of Bismack happened in the 2012-13 season, in which he managed an underwhelming 4.8 points, 1.8 blocks, and 7.3 rebounds.</p><p>It was well below the expectations that were laid upon him at the beginning of his NBA career.</p><p>Consequently, the Charlotte-based franchise declined the opportunity to extend Biyombo’s contract by one more year for the 2015-16 season, making him a free agent.</p><p>Following his release from the Charlotte Bobcats, Biyombo said, – “In Charlotte, first you get the opportunity. But you have all this pressure. I didn’t have the opportunity to do what I needed to,”</p><p>Soon after, the Toronto Raptors signed a two-year $6 million contract, with the second year being a player option.</p><p>The 6 feet 8 center became a force in the franchise’s run to the Eastern Conference Finals as he became a shot-blocking and rebounding force with averages of 6.2 points, 1.4 blocks, and 9.4 rebounds during the playoffs.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/biyombo-233.jpg><p>Subsequently, the Congo native declined his player option for the 2016-17 season since he was not the Raptors’ starting center.</p><p>Contrarily, while the time with the Raptors was limited to just one season, Biyombo stated that he cherished the experience of reaching the Conference Finals and the city of Toronto.</p><p>Having recently been impressed with the Raptors, many franchises were interested in Biyombo, but the Orlando Magic secured his services in the end.</p><p>Likewise, Bismack signed the most lucrative deal of his career with the Hornets.</p><p>Specifically, the Congo native signed a four-year <strong>$72 million</strong> contract with the Charlotte-based franchise.</p><p>After that, the 6 feet 8 centers remained with the franchise for two years averaging 5.8 points, 1.1 blocks, and 6.4 rebounds per game.</p><p><strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Diego Rossi Bio: Career, Stats, Salary, Transfers, Wife Wiki >></a></strong></p><p>Although Biyombo did not put up eye-catching numbers, he was a leader in the dressing room, helping young players settle and develop.</p><p>His time with the Orlando-based franchise was cut short as Bismack got traded to the team with whom the &nbsp;31-year-old started his NBA career, Charlotte Hornets.</p><p>Subsequently, the 6 feet 9 centers put up 4.4 points, 4.6 rebounds, and 0.8 blocks per game, which was disappointing for a talented player like Biyombo.</p><p>On the contrary, the Congo native was injured for most of the season as he could only appear 54 times for the Hornets.</p><p>Biyombo has managed to stay injury-free as he has played in 52 games for the franchise owned by the possibly best player in NBA history, <strong>Michael Jordan</strong>.</p><p>Similarly, the 6 feet 8 centers have upped his average from last season as Bismack is averaging career-high 7.5 points along with 0.9 blocks and 5.9 rebounds per game.</p><p>After Magic, the basketball player signed the contract with &nbsp;Charlotte Hornets a three-term deal.</p><p>The Charlotte Hornets currently sit in the 10th position in the Eastern Conference standings with 18 games still left to play.</p><p>Furthermore, the franchise is six games behind Biyombo’s former team, which occupies the final playoff spot, Orlando Magic.</p><p><strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Damian Lillard Bio: Career, Stats, Contract, Endorsements Wiki >></a></strong></p><p>To conclude, considering the quality of players in the roster and the upturn in the form of the 6 foot 8 centers, who’s to say that the Charlotte Hornets cannot reach the playoffs.</p><p>Also, let’s hope that Bismack manages to stay injury-free for the rest of the season.</p><h2>Bismack Biyombo | Career Stats</h2><table class="vk_tbl Uekwlc"><tbody><tr><th class="Z3XQ4e Gt0LNd"></th><th class="Z3XQ4e Gt0LNd"></th><th class="Z3XQ4e Gt0LNd r4NXy"

from<a href=# rel=noopener> here</a>.</p><h2>Bismack Biyombo | Age, Height & Body Measurements</h2><p>Currently, the Hornets center is &nbsp;31 years old, which is quite young for a player that has played in the NBA for nine years.</p><p>On the contrary, it seems like Bismack is way beyond his age according to his gameplay and lifestyle.</p><p>The Congolese center stands at 6 feet 8 inches tall, making him a bit small compared to other centers in the league.</p><p>Contrarily, the relatively short height helps Bismarck to get off the ground to grab rebounds quickly.</p><p>The Hornets center can also quickly switch from the forwards and guard the defenders due to his agility.</p><p>In conclusion, Biyombo is one of the best squad players who can replace the starting center whenever required.</p><p>As a result, whoever signs Bismack after he hits the free agency this summer will be getting their hands on possibly the best substitute center in the NBA.</p><h2>Bismack Biyombo | Net Worth & Contract</h2><p>Biyombo is worth a massive <strong>$30 million</strong> at the time of writing due to his NBA longevity.</p><p>To illustrate, the Congolese is now in his ninth season and his third different team, including Toronto Raptors, Orlando Magic, and Charlotte Hornets.</p><p>Furthermore, the Hornets player had earned an average of <strong>$2.5 million</strong> until the 2016-17
