He made a congratulatory post for his daughter, whom he had&nbsp;reportedly never met.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>This post infuriated many of Cat's fans, and they created an uproar that caused his post to be taken down. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>Doja Cat's Dad Thanks Everyone for Supporting His Daughter</h2><p>Right after Cat's Grammy win for Best Pop Duo/Group Performance for 'Kiss Me More,' Dlamini took to Instagram to put up a <a href=# rel="follow noopener">congratulatory post</a> for his daughter. <span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-10 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-9 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span></p><p>"Just wanted to thank everyone who supported my child Zandile God bless you all," Dlamini wrote in the upload. Cat's real name is Amala Ratna Zandile Dlamini.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span> <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p><strong>Doja Cat's father, Dumisani Dlamini, made a congratulatory post after her Grammys win, but their bad relationship made her fans angry about the post.</strong> (Photo: <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Instagram</a>) <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-169 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Alongside the thankful words, he posted a picture of Cat posing for the cameras after her win. She was holding her trophy and had a wide grin on her face.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>However, considering the bitter past between the two, fans didn't take long to bash the&nbsp;Sarafina&nbsp;actor for his post after an alleged life-long absence from Cat's life, <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>Fans Slam Doja Cat's Father for His Post</h2><p>The comment section of Dlamini's post was filled with comments telling him to stop with his post, which they saw as attention-grabbing antics.</p><p>"You an absent father, relax bro," one wrote. Another one chimed in with a brutal "Fans had to support her because you didn't."</p><p>Many were asking him to leave her alone and that the post was "Embarrassing." A few others called him a "deadbeat" father. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>"Have y'all even met?" asked a user, a callback to the time when Cat said she had never met her father.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>A user even used the recent <a href=# rel=follow>Chris Rock-Will Smith slap incident</a> as his crutch for a joke. "KEEP HER NAME OUT OF YOUR MOUTH," they wrote.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Calling his post a "shameless" act, another wrote, "Have some shame please. Probably don't even know what song she won for smh." Going with the theme of Dlamini not knowing about Cat, someone asked what her favorite food was.</p><p>After a lot of these critical comments, Dlamini was forced to do something. Therefore, he has since removed his Instagram post. However, the screenshots live on within&nbsp;gossip and fan accounts.</p><h2>History between Doja Cat and Dad Dumisani Dlamini</h2><p>Cat first talked about her relationship with her father&nbsp;while talking to <a href=# rel=follow>Whoopi Goldberg</a>. During one of their conversations, she <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">expressed her happiness</a> at meeting Goldberg.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>"I'm just thinking about my dad 'cause he was in&nbsp;Sarafina!&nbsp;so seeing you and meeting you is like the craziest thing," she confessed to Goldberg. In response, the TV host said Dlamini was a "good man." <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-618 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>But, Cat then said she had never met him. "I didn't get to meet him but you did," she revealed. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Dlamini was in Sarafina! with Goldberg, but, according to rumors, he left for South Africa right after that to further his acting career.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p>His side of the story is different, though. In 2017, he claimed he had tried to reach out to his daughter, but her management company had been blocking his attempts at getting through to her.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>Further, he also said Cat had been exaggerating their lack of relationship or communication.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaJyfn65ur8CtZJ%2BZpJ2ys3nTsJyerF6dwa64</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fdoja-cat-father-tweet-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fdoja-cat-father-tweet-html.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fdoja-cat-father-tweet-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fdoja-cat-father-tweet-html.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fdoja-cat-father-tweet-html.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fdoja-cat-father-tweet-html.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./mandy-rose-wwe-wrestling-sequin-bra-fantime-instagram.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./mandy-rose-wwe-wrestling-sequin-bra-fantime-instagram.html>Former WWE star Mandy Rose threatens to burst out of tiny sequin bra as amazed fans ask 'how tight i</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./all-about-joan-collins-children.html>All About Tara, Alexander and Katyana</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./all-about-joan-collins-children.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
