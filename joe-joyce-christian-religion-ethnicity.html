<time>04 Jul 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p><strong>The netizens often shower the British-born boxer Joe Joyce with queries regarding his ethnicity and religion.</strong></p><p>Even if Joyce prefers to give the silent treatment, fans are already taking turns to assume & dig in about his personal life.</p><p>While there is no clear answer about his religious belief, it is known that the boxer, with an impressive 15-1 record, grew up and studied in a predominantly white neighborhood located in Putney.</p><p>But there is no doubt he believes in the religion of hard work & a strive for betterment.</p><p>Keeping aspects of his personal life on hold, Joe does have answers to the raised eyebrows about his potential as a fighter.</p><p>He began boxing relatively late, at the age of 22, which is much later than some of the great champions in the sport, like <a href=#>Mike Tyson</a>, who won a heavyweight title at 20 & became the youngest heavyweight champion in history.</p><p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Joe-Joyce-1.jpg></p><p>Despite starting later than many boxers, Joyce has been successful in the boxing world.</p><p>He has competed at the national level and won a silver medal in the super heavyweight class at the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Olympic Games.</p><p>Furthermore, Joyce has held the WBO interim heavyweight title from 2022 until April 2023.</p><h2>Joe Joyce Ethnicity & Religion</h2><p>The London-born boxer comes from a mixed ethnic heritage. He was born to a Nigerian mother and a Scottish-born Irish father.</p><p>Joyce grew up and studied in a predominantly white neighborhood in Putney, South West London.</p><p>There has been some speculation regarding Joyce’s religious beliefs. While some sources have suggested that he may be Jewish or Muslim, the majority of sources cite him as a Christian.</p><p>However, Joyce has not confirmed any particular religious affiliation and has not publicly stated which religion, if any, he follows.</p><p>There is no indication from any of the boxer’s social media posts that he adheres to any particular religion.</p><p>Though, he likes to talk about spirituality and often shares stories & quotes about spiritual beliefs on his social media.</p><p>It is worth noting that many athletes prefer to keep their religious beliefs private, and seems Joe Joyce is no exception.</p><h2>Family Details Of Joe Joyce</h2><p>Joe Joyce was born on September 19, 1985, to Marvel Opara and Phillip Joyce. But his parents are not together now; they separated when he was just two years old.</p><p>His father, Phillip, attended Stanway Secondary School before enrolling in Sir Charles Lucas School.</p><p>Phillip also pursued Newland Park Teachers Training and now serves as the managing director of The Gliding Workshop.</p><p>On the other hand, his mother, Marvel, is registered blind with only seven percent vision and currently resides in London, United Kingdom.</p><p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Joe-Joyce-With-His-Mother-Younger-Brother.jpg></p><p>She became blind following an accident when she was four and attended a school for visually impaired children.</p><p>Well, Joe’s mother, Marvel, is no short of being an inspiration to her kids & to the community. She trained in martial arts and even climbed Mount Kilimanjaro with the help of a guide in 2017.</p><p>Additionally, she is a fan of pottery and passed on her artistic skills to Joe, who also uses painting as a form of relaxation. In fact, the boxer has painted his idol, <a href=#>Muhammad Ali</a>.</p><p>Joe Joyce has a younger brother named Torann Opara, who is currently a high school student and a musical artist.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmionJbGpr7Sm6CoZpOkunC2zp5ko6epmLJur8eroKysmZa7br7EpaCgoZ%2BjeqbAx6egnKGkrnw%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fjoe-joyce-christian-religion-ethnicity.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fjoe-joyce-christian-religion-ethnicity.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fjoe-joyce-christian-religion-ethnicity.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fjoe-joyce-christian-religion-ethnicity.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fjoe-joyce-christian-religion-ethnicity.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fjoe-joyce-christian-religion-ethnicity.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./is-mackenzie-mcdonald-asian-ethnicity-nationality-and-religion.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./is-mackenzie-mcdonald-asian-ethnicity-nationality-and-religion.html>Is Mackenzie McDonald Asian Ethnicity, Nationality And Religion</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./get-to-know-former-nba-player-chris-webber-s-wife-erika-dates-and-family-html.html>Get To Know Former NBA Player Chris Webbers Wife Erika Dates and Family</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./get-to-know-former-nba-player-chris-webber-s-wife-erika-dates-and-family-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
