Unseen Sunscreen first. The formula is completely transparent, so you won’t have to worry about streaking or white cast. It’s made with red algae to boost moisture, frankincense to soothe the skin, and an oil complex that also contributes to moisturization. The consistency of this chemical sunscreen feels like a velvety, silicone primer, making it ideal for layering under your makeup.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Those with dry skin who tested this sunscreen loved the moisturizing effect (thanks to the aforementioned ingredients!), and those with oily skin said it didn’t feel too greasy, though there was slight oil transfer after blotting with the blotting sheets, which likely could have just been our own natural oils. It spreads and absorbs easily, and a little goes a long way, so the package should last you a while. It does take a few minutes to dry, but we appreciated that it’s unscented (for those with sensitive skin) and didn’t cause any irritation.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">During our water test, this lotion proved completely water-resistant. After spraying water on our skin, we could see the water droplets resting on our face, but the absorbed sunscreen didn’t run or streak at all. Sweat is no match for Supergoop.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>How it held up: </strong>When we tested this sunscreen at home over the course of two weeks, it continued to impress us by absorbing well and leaving a clean, matte finish. So whether you’re heading out for a day at the beach, out in the sun playing a sport, or just using it for daily wear, this sunscreen is at the top of our list.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Type: </strong>Chemical | <strong>Water-Resistant:</strong> Yes | <strong>SPF:</strong> 40 <strong>| Size: </strong>1.7 fl oz. | <strong>Consistency: </strong>Lotion | <strong>Scent: </strong>Unscented</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-budget-cerave-hydrating-mineral-face-sunscreen-lotion-spf-30></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Budget</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>CeraVe Hydrating Mineral Face Sunscreen Lotion</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="CeraVe Hydrating Mineral Sunscreen " style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/J0JkA22CTL3dcrTridOhC9c5_XM=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/cerave-hydrating-mineral-sunscreen-178ce498baec4db3a71c843ee0585e2a.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Target</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Feel</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.7</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Transfer</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Opacity</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Water Resistance</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=0.5><li readability=2><p>Despite being a mineral sunscreen, this creamy formula blends well with no streaking, so long as you thoroughly work it into the skin</p></li><li readability=-1><p>Absorbs in a matter of minutes</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This mineral sunscreen from Cerave is affordable, effective, and passed our tests with flying colors. We loved the creamy consistency and lightweight feel of the formula and matte finish. It’s a broad-spectrum sunscreen (meaning it protects against damaging UVA and UVB rays) and is packed with incredible ingredients like niacinamide to boost collagen production, hyaluronic acid to moisturize, and ceramides to continually repair and maintain the skin barrier. It doesn’t have a fragrance, but the smell of the natural product was pleasant.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">During application, our team found this sunscreen easy to spread (though some extra elbow grease was necessary to really work it in), quite absorbent, and non-irritating. Considering the 15-minute test period, the sunscreen actually dried exceptionally quickly — around the three-minute mark and had a smooth matte finish once applied. This sunscreen isn’t advertised as being water-resistant, but proved to be during testing —&nbsp;it didn’t run when water was sprayed on our faces. There was some white residue, but that’s generally normal for formulas with zinc oxide and titanium oxide because these agents block the sun from the skin barrier rather than fully absorbing, so unless you spend a lot of time rubbing it in, you’re bound to see some trace of it. We did find that it left a slight chalky white cast on dark skin tones.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>How it held up:</strong> After the two-week home-testing period, our love for this sunscreen endured. It continued to be water-resistant (even when facing gym sweat) and when one member of our team applied the sunscreen over a full face of makeup, it absorbed just fine, without looking cake-y or feeling greasy — an impressive feat.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Type: </strong>Mineral | <strong>Water-Resistant:</strong> Yes | <strong>SPF:</strong> 30 <strong>| Size: </strong>2.5 fl oz. | <strong>Consistency: </strong>Lotion | <strong>Scent: </strong>Unscented</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-sensitive-skin-kinship-self-reflect-spf-32-probiotic-moisturizing-sunscreen></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best for Sensitive Skin</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Kinship Moisturizing Sunscreen</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Kinship Self Reflect SPF 32 Probiotic Moisturizing Sunscreen" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/K1gaexpfg_n2SjlJ15J-54wZwu0=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/kinship-self-reflect-spf-32-probiotic-moisturizing-sunscreen-7fbf9578ccb84e9dbfe63e7207d4a09a.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Feel</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.9</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Transfer</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Opacity</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.8</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Water Resistance</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Removal</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=2.5><li readability=0><p>Features a very lightweight, non-greasy consistency</p></li><li readability=0><p>Universal light pink tint leaves behind a subtle, healthy glow</p></li><li readability=2><p>Our tester, who has found that other sunscreens break them out, did not notice any irritation with this formula — it also didn't exacerbate their existing breakouts</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">For someone with sensitive skin, Kinship's Self Reflect sunscreen is a must. Our team (including those with sensitive and allergy-prone skin) tested this sunscreen and had zero irritation or redness. This is largely due to ingredients like non-nano zinc oxide (which means it isn't as easily absorbed into the skin), soothing turmeric, and a probiotic dubbed “Kinbiome” that strengthens the skin barrier, an important factor for someone with sensitive, redness-prone skin. When applying this gentle formula, the consistency was like a lightweight lotion that blended seamlessly and leaves behind a non-greasy sheen. In fact, its light pink tint actually imparted what our testers felt was a healthy glow, which was especially nice under foundation.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">In terms of other qualities, this sunscreen held up against the water-resistance test without running, though we noticed some streaking after spraying our faces. It didn’t create any oiliness, and there was very little oil transfer on the blotting paper we used. And in terms of scent, it does have a subtle vanilla fragrance, although this is naturally-derived from vanilla planifolia fruit extract, and we actually really enjoyed it. Considering how much we liked using this sunscreen, we took comfort in knowing it will likely last a long time as we only had to use a little product to cover our whole face.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>How it held up: </strong>After a two-week home testing period, our team continued to see the same results and were pleased with this sunscreen’s ability to perform throughout exercise and day-to-day activities.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Type: </strong>Mineral | <strong>Water-Resistant:</strong> Partially | <strong>SPF:</strong> 32 <strong>| Size: </strong>1.75 oz. | <strong>Consistency: </strong>Lotion | <strong>Scent: </strong>Unscented</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-melanin-rich-skin-black-girl-sunscreen-broad-spectrum-spf-30></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best for Melanin-Rich Skin</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Black Girl Sunscreen Broad Spectrum SPF 30</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Black Girl Sunscreen Broad Spectrum SPF 30" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/KSs0leN9reywyjQ7p52183nLzn4=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/black-girl-sunscreen-spf-30-d576cc80751a49ddb67c544503458771.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Ulta</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Feel</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.3</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Transfer</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Opacity</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.7</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Water Resistance</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Removal</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=1.5><li readability=-1><p>Does not run or streak during physical activity or contact with water</p></li><li readability=-1><p>Removes easily compared with other sunscreens</p></li><li readability=0><p>Consistency is similar to a lightweight moisturizer and leaves behind a healthy, dewy sheen</p></li><li readability=-1><p>Has a slight cooling effect on contact</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Designed specifically for <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>melanin-rich skin</a> (though suitable for all skin tones), this sunscreen will protect your face without leaving a white cast in its wake. It’s a super lightweight formula that applies ultra sheer on your skin, and includes jojoba and avocado oils to create a subtle, soothing glow, which many of our testers loved. (However, one tester with combination skin did say she felt the finish was too greasy, so you will likely notice a difference in the finish based on your personal skin type.) We also found that this sunscreen had an immediate cooling effect, which would surely be welcome on a hot day or over sunburned skin.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">It’s water-resistant for up to 80 minutes, and proved that claim during our testing. Due to the natural oils in the formula, there was some transfer on the blotting paper, which is to be expected. The sunscreen is unscented and non-irritating. Overall, this is a high-quality sunscreen that would work well for many different skin types and tones, and after testing it for two weeks at home, our team stands by this review — we were appreciative of how well it blended into the skin and how lightweight it feels.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Type: </strong>Chemical | <strong>Water-Resistant:</strong> Yes | <strong>SPF:</strong> 30 <strong>| Size: </strong>3 fl oz. | <strong>Consistency: </strong>Lotion | <strong>Scent: </strong>Unscented</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-acne-prone-skin-hero-cosmetics-superlight-sunscreen-spf-30></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best for Acne-Prone Skin</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Hero Cosmetics Superlight Sunscreen SPF 30</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Hero Cosmetics Superlight Sunscreen SPF 30" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/YXjhz3hjpHJSG_mTyURDJ6vBjs8=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/HeroCosmeticsForceShieldSuperlightSunscreenSPF30-04bd475668a74651add7de9b8f77898b.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Feel</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Transfer</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Opacity</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.3</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Water Resistance</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Removal</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=2><li readability=-1><p>Features a light green tint that helps counteract redness</p></li><li readability=-1><p>No oily transfer was detected in our blotting tests</p></li><li readability=1><p>The finish feels similar to a makeup primer, creating a smooth, even base</p></li><li readability=-1><p>Water droplets sat on top of this product rather than causing streaking and running</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-31 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you have acne-prone skin, you probably look for oil-free products that won’t clog your pores (and cause blackheads), and this physical sunscreen creates a layer of protection without the look or feel of oil on your skin. It’s super lightweight, glides onto the skin, and rubs in easily.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Utilizing color theory — which has seen a recent uptick <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nocaes>on TikTok</a> — this formula has a slight green tint which counteracts redness. As opposite colors on the color wheel, red and green are complementary and can be used to neutralize one another. So, applying a green tint on the skin will mask any redness (like blemishes), which is exactly what this sunscreen does. Using just a little product, you can cover your whole face, and the silky formula absorbs after only a few minutes, without any trace of the green left.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-33 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The sunscreen doesn’t have any noticeable scent, and it proved to be quite water-resistant. Plus it creates a subtle sheen on your face, leaving behind a healthy glow. Our team didn’t experience any irritation with this formula, and it had next to no oil transfer, which, again, is ideal for those with oily or combination skin that’s acne-prone. These results were consistent when the sunscreen was tested at home — one tester with proclaimed sensitive skin said she had no reaction at all to this formula. Given how fast this product dries, we believe it would work well under makeup, almost like a primer —&nbsp;perfect to prep (and protect) the skin.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-34 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Type: </strong>Mineral | <strong>Water-Resistant:</strong> Yes | <strong>SPF:</strong> 30 <strong>| Size: </strong>50 ml | <strong>Consistency: </strong>Lotion | <strong>Scent: </strong>Unscented</p><ul class="loc carousel-items mntl-carousel__items"><li id=mntl-carousel__item_1-0-15 class="comp is-active mntl-carousel__item mntl-block" data-ordinal=0><img width=1500 height=5600 data-sizes=750px alt="Hero Cosmetics Superlight Sunscreen SPF 30 displayed on counter next to qtips " data-expand=300 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/tKx6PIZf3SuQXK7uOzx2ZU8sCtk=/fit-in/1500x5600/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/peo-product-hero-cosmetics-superlight-sunscreen-jthompson-0171-c5ba3d26fd0a48c380545a5cc3e1791e.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>People / Jhett Thompson</p></span></li><li id=mntl-carousel__item_1-0-16 class="comp mntl-carousel__item mntl-block" data-ordinal=1><img width=1500 height=4034 data-sizes=750px alt="Closeup Hero Cosmetics Superlight Sunscreen SPF 30" data-expand=300 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/_4r0NzgBjW_yXYaJPbGp5PYnJ8g=/fit-in/1500x4034/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/peo-detail-hero-cosmetics-superlight-sunscreen-jthompson-0176-47c4e95ce94f403a968fed5386e8e2e2.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>People / Jhett Thompson</p></span></li></ul><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-dry-skin-eltamd-uv-daily-broad-spectrum-spf-40></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best for Dry Skin</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>EltaMD UV Daily Broad-Spectrum</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="EltaMD UV Daily Broad-Spectrum SPF 40" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/u66tMEn3Cep46YoP7L2BEFUgzak=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/EltaMD-UV-Daily-Broad-Spectrum-SPF-40-37853e2e42d44fa490fefd50384dda7f.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Feel</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.7</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Transfer</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Opacity</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>3.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Water Resistance</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Removal</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=-0.5><li readability=0><p>Moisturizer-like consistency leaves behind a nice, hydrating finish</p></li><li readability=-1><p>Does not run or streak at all during physical activity</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-38 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The sun can be very drying due to the depletion of essential fatty acids and subsequent thickening of the skin, making it appear and look flaky, so if you already have dry skin, you’ll want a sunscreen with some moisturizing properties. This dermatologist-loved sunscreen uses hyaluronic acid to not just moisturize the skin, but create a barrier to prevent moisture loss. After trying this sunscreen firsthand, we liked its lightweight feel and ease of application. There was no streaking or any kind of greasy feeling like you encounter with some sun products.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-39 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">A little went a long way here, and we were able to cover our entire face with the recommended amount of sunscreen.

Another dermatologist-favorite, this mineral sunscreen with an SPF of 50+ will protect your skin no matter how much water you encounter. It passed our water-resistance test with flying colors and stayed in place while being directly sprayed — in fact, the water droplets seemed to bead up and roll off rather than cause the formula to run. It goes on super sheer and feels lightweight on your skin, almost mimicking a chemical sunscreen rather than other thicker, physical ones.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-47 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The formula also boasts “DNA Repairsomes®” —&nbsp;let’s discuss. Basically, these are photolyase enzymes, or a type of enzyme that specifically repairs DNA after ultraviolet damage (aka one too many sunburns). In other words, it protects against future sun damage and works to repair existing damage.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-48 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We loved how seamlessly this sunscreen blended into the skin. There are no streaks, no white cast that settles into fine lines, and no irritation. Plus, you only have to use a little product to cover your whole face. The consistency of this sunscreen makes it a great option for wearing under makeup — which proved achievable during home testing — and for adding a healthy glow to your complexion without oily residue. And we recognize that it’s a little pricey, but the package contains a decent amount of product, making it a good value over time.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-49 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Type: </strong>Mineral | <strong>Water-Resistant:</strong> Yes | <strong>SPF:</strong> 50 <strong>| Size: </strong>3.4 fl oz. | <strong>Consistency: </strong>Lotion | <strong>Scent: </strong>Subtle scent</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-lightweight-summer-fridays-shadedrops-broad-spectrum-spf-30-mineral-milk-sunscreen></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Lightweight</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Summer Fridays ShadeDrops SPF 30 Mineral Milk Sunscreen</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Summer Fridays ShadeDrops Broad Spectrum SPF 30 Mineral Milk Sunscreen" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/SDgREpPho2frzqa6lo_3_nAxp2k=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/summer-fridays-shadedrops-broad-spectrum-spf-30-mineral-milk-sunscreen-01f0d044f3274612b63b1b44eb19f24c.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Sephora</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Feel</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.8</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Transfer</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Opacity</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Water Resistance</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Removal</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=1><li readability=-1><p>Can be applied over makeup</p></li><li readability=-1><p>Thin consistency absorbs within a matter of seconds</p></li><li readability=-1><p>Tinted formula leaves behind a healthy sheen</p></li><li readability=-1><p>Washes off easily with a standard facial cleanser</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-53 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This mineral sunscreen is quite lightweight compared to most others we tested (one tester even likened it to Chanel Vitalumière Aqua SPF foundation) and is easily spreadable and blendable with a slightly matte finish. It’s also tinted which is great to avoid the white cast that can happen with some sunscreen products and is compatible with all skin tones. In addition to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>using self tanner on your face</a>, this tinted formula can also give you a sun-kissed glow. You can use a small amount of this sunscreen; it absorbed within a matter of seconds, the quickest of all products we tested.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-54 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Despite the Summer Fridays formula being rather thin and runny, it held up (for the most part) in our water test. When sprayed our faces with water, the somewhat milky product didn’t run, but there was some streaking.

We think it feels similar to the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Ilia Skin Tint Foundation</a> because it’s such a sheer formula and has a bit of a tint as well. Though one of the ingredients is zinc, this product doesn’t leave behind a white cast, so it’s easy to wear under makeup, and you don’t even need to use a moisturizer because it’s quite hydrating, thanks to ingredients like jojoba and chamomile. Just like <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>your favorite vitamin C serum</a>, the addition of Vitamin C in this product gives you added protection against the sun.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-61 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Though it’s a mineral sunscreen, it’s quite thin, so it’s a lot easier to blend and can be absorbed as fast as chemical sunscreens. This sunscreen isn’t listed as fragrance-free, but doesn’t have an artificial fragrance; we couldn’t really pick up a scent beyond the normal smell of sunscreen with this product. The transfer test saw some oil on the blotting sheet, which isn’t a deal breaker for us, because several of us have naturally oily skin which could account for this transfer. There were no irritations and it gave our skin a nice glow. You could even wear it alone as <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>SPF makeup</a>. And despite not being listed as “water-resistant”, this formula did not run when sprayed with water.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-62 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>How it held up: </strong>After testing at home, we found this sunscreen to be great under makeup as a daily primer layer because it absorbs so quickly into the skin. That said, don’t let the SPF of 50 lure you into a false sense of security; this is a thin formula, so, if you’re planning to wear it for a day in the sun, be prepared to reapply!</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-63 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Type: </strong>Mineral | <strong>Water-Resistant:</strong> Yes | <strong>SPF:</strong> 50 <strong>| Size: </strong>1.3 oz. | <strong>Consistency: </strong>Lotion | <strong>Scent: </strong>Unscented</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-translucent-glossier-invisible-shield-spf-35></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Translucent</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Glossier Invisible Shield SPF 35</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Sephora Glossier Invisible Shield SPF 35" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/psfmzpLjA4fielBuGt9yP1jfG48=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/glossier-invisible-shield-spf-35-97d33dd36f7c4df8962a548c0fa6cc74.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Sephora</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Feel</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Transfer</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Opacity</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.8</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Removal</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=1><li readability=-1><p>Has a serum-like consistency and goes on completely clear</p></li><li readability=0><p>Has a nice slip that glides onto the skin, similar to a primer</p></li><li readability=0><p>Despite not being advertised as waterproof or water-resistant, this sunscreen did not run at all</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-67 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">For those who want to avoid the white cast left by many sunscreens, you won’t have to worry about that with this Glossier sunscreen. This super lightweight gel serum isn’t cake-y or greasy, and absorbs easily into the skin thanks to active microcapsules loaded with UVA/UVB filters that deliver into your skin as opposed to sitting atop it in a gloppy formula. Essentially, it goes on clear and then disappears: a magic trick among suncare products.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-68 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">It only takes a small amount of sunscreen to cover your whole face, and doesn’t leave any kind of sticky residue or sheen. And though clear, this sunscreen makes its presence known with a light citrus scent, thanks to the added sweet orange peel oil. It smelled delicious to us, but could be too strong for those with sensitive noses.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-69 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">During testing, this sunscreen won major points for not causing irritation and holding up against a spray bottle to prove it is water-resistant; it didn’t run at all. We noticed some oil transferred onto the blotting sheet after wearing the sunscreen, but this can be attributed to the natural oils of some team members’ skin. Then we took the test home and continued using the sunscreen for two weeks, at which point, we were still impressed — especially by how well it absorbs, moisturizes, and layers under makeup without issue.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-70 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Type: </strong>Chemical | <strong>Water-Resistant:</strong> Yes | <strong>SPF:</strong> 35 <strong>| Size: </strong>1 fl oz. | <strong>Consistency: </strong>Gel | <strong>Scent: </strong>Citrus scent</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-other-face-sunscreens-we-tested></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--people commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Other Face Sunscreens We Tested</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim"><strong>Cocokind Silk SPF 30</strong></a>: This vegan formula is actually a hybrid between chemical and mineral sunscreen which offers unique benefits. For instance, this sunscreen provides what is classified as broad-spectrum coverage because it protects your skin against UVA and UVB rays with a blend of zinc oxide (mineral sunscreen component) and homosalate (chemical sunscreen component).

Again, this formula is a bit creamy and deeply moisturizes, so we noticed some oil-transfer after the test, and for that reason, we might suggest a different product if you have oily skin. This sunscreen is not water-resistant, which our tests confirmed, so it might work best as a daily moisturizing product under your makeup, rather than a sunscreen to wear outside in direct sun exposure that you would need to reapply throughout the day. After two weeks of testing this face sunscreen at home, we still love its feel and effectiveness.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nocaes><strong>Dr. Rossi Derm MD The Day Formula</strong></a>: Created by a dermatologist, Dr. Rossi Derm MD The Day sunscreen is designed to protect against UV rays while also tackling skin concerns related to aging—&nbsp;hence the larger price tag.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">In terms of sun protection, the formula contains titanium dioxide, an agent that prevents too much UVA and UVB ray exposure. Also among its ingredients is niacinamide (aka vitamin B3), a moisturizing vitamin that boosts collagen production and reduces wrinkles. Together, these active ingredients fight sun damage, and improve the texture and overall appearance.

We could definitely feel its presence, even after it was fully absorbed, but it didn’t feel oily or greasy. In fact, we really appreciated the matte finish rather than the common shine so many other sunscreens leave behind.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Though not labeled as water-resistant, this sunscreen proved to have some resistance during testing as there were no droplets or signs of running when sprayed. It did leave some white residue behind until thoroughly blended into the skin, and when faced with an oil-blotting sheet, some of the product did transfer. After continued testing at home, we discovered additional benefits, like how well this sunscreen layers under our blush and bronzer, almost acting like a primer without becoming blotchy, patchy, or cake-y.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow nocaes"><strong>Coola Classic Face Organic Fragrance-Free Sunscreen Lotion</strong></a>: The Coola sunscreen is ideal for those with sensitive noses because it doesn’t have any artificial fragrance in the formula.

We appreciated the sheer and lightweight feel of the sunscreen, though you do have to rub it in quite a bit for it to absorb since it’s a mineral sunscreen.

It does give off a slight sheen in the finish, and there was some oil transfer, but overall we liked the look and feel of this sunscreen.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>How it held up:</strong> While home-testing, we noticed the sunscreen frequently added a dewy glow to our skin.

When you spend time outside, there are two types of ultraviolet rays to know about: UVA and UVB. UVA rays are the kind that sneak up on you on cloudy days and can cause long-term skin damage without necessarily leaving sunburn as evidence. UVB rays are more common and cause a traditional sunburn. So, SPF stands for sun protection factor, and refers to the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nocaes>time it takes for the UV rays to redden your skin</a> when wearing the sunscreen exactly as directed versus not. For instance, if you have a facial sunscreen that’s SPF 30, it means it will take 30 times longer for UV rays to burn your skin than if you were wearing nothing.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Dr. Perkins suggests using a “broad-spectrum” sunscreen (meaning it covers both UVA + UVB rays) that has “a minimum SPF of 30.” A word of caution: While higher SPF levels do offer better protection, they often create bad habits like staying out in the sun longer without reapplying. So regardless of the SPF level you wear, Dr. Perkins suggests reapplying every two hours for maximum protection.&nbsp;Don't forget about also protecting your eyes from the sun with a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>good pair of sunglasses</a>.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--people commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Chemical vs. Physical Sunscreen&nbsp;</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">SPF also works differently depending on the type of sunscreen — and there are two: physical (which includes mineral) and chemical sunscreens. “Physical sunscreens — zinc oxide and titanium dioxide — sit atop the skin and reflect UV radiation,” says Dr. Perkins. “Chemical sunscreens, on the other hand, must be absorbed into the skin where they can absorb the heat from UV radiation and prevent resulting damage.” Chemical sunscreens have been controversial in that they are more likely to cause <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nocaes>skin irritation</a> for those with reactive skin, and common ingredients like oxybenzone and octinoxate&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nocaes>have been associated</a>&nbsp;with harming coral reefs and are banned in places like Hawaii and Thailand. Depending on your location and skin type, you'll want to tailor your ingredients to those factors when choosing the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>best sunscreen for your needs</a>.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--people commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Skin Type</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">As mentioned before, your skin type might determine the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>best facial sunscreen</a> you should use on a daily basis. “Those with eczema, allergies or skin sensitivity should consider using physical sunscreens, which are less likely to cause irritation,” says Dr. Perkins. She recommends that those interested in light coverage (in addition to protection) might opt for something tinted. “Iron oxides in tinted sunscreen can block the absorption of visible light, which can also contribute to pigmentation,” she says. She also suggests a matte or powder formula for those with oily skin, and oil-free options for those with acne-prone skin, as well as “ingredients like niacinamide, which is anti-inflammatory.” Those with dry skin can also <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>consider a moisturizer with SPF</a>.<br></p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-image--people commerce-sc-block-image--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>People / Jhett Thompson</p></span></figure><span class=heading-toc id=toc-how-we-tested-face-sunscreen></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--people commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>How We Tested Face Sunscreen</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">During a day in the lab, we tested all the qualities you might consider when buying a face sunscreen and put 24 of the top-rated picks to the test. For each sunscreen, we took a moisture reading of our face, and then applied the manufacturer amount of product on freshly cleansed skin — covering one half of our face. After rubbing the sunscreen in, our team waited 15 minutes to let it absorb and dry, and then took another moisture reading.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">To test how much oil was in the sunscreen, we did a transfer test, and dabbed a sheet of blotting paper around our cheeks, chin, nose, and forehead. We also sprayed the side of our face that had sunscreen on it to see how well it held up against elements like sweat, rain, and the sea water (or any other water you might encounter). We continued testing at home over the course of two weeks, using the sunscreen at least three times per week. Throughout both types of tests, we considered the feel of the product, the transfer, the opacity, water resistance, and whether it caused any irritation.<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-faq-0a8df11c-abfc-4182-aeb0-0f280b68ad2f></span><p>Frequently Asked Questions</p><ul id=mntl-sc-block-faq__content_1-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block-faq__content mntl-accordion" readability=49.242424242424><li class="accordion__item js-accordion-item is-active" readability=-1><p><span class=accordion__title>What is the difference between face and body sunscreen?</span></p><p>There are different considerations when looking for sunscreen for your face versus your body, but also some similarities.&nbsp;“Body sunscreens, like facial sunscreens, may contain either physical or chemical blockers,” says Perkins. She emphasizes texture and how people prefer lightweight lotions that rub in more easily (especially for the face, if you’re wearing it under your makeup, where body sunscreens tend to be a bit heavier). You'll also want to consider the volume of the bottle given the body has more surface area to cover. “Body sunscreens also need to cover a much larger area, so larger size [bottles and tubes] can be more convenient,” she adds.</p></li><li class="accordion__item js-accordion-item is-active" readability=-0.96672354948805><p><span class=accordion__title>Are there certain ingredients in sunscreen you should stay away from?</span></p><p>In general, Dr. Perkins recommends avoiding added chemicals, parabens, and fragrance as much as possible due to the potential for irritation. She says that there has also been “some concern regarding the impacts of chemical sunscreen absorption into the bloodstream, as well as environmental harm due to some chemical sunscreens.” This refers to common chemicals found in sunscreen that can absorb into your bloodstream; however, more research needs to be done here as to whether they are actually harmful to the human body. Many of these ingredients, like <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nocaes>oxybenzone, homosalate, and octocrylene</a>, are all regulated by the FDA.</p><p>While there’s been much discussion surrounding certain sunscreen chemicals being linked to cancer — including several recalls of popular sunscreen brands (not included on our list) that contain benzene — Dr. Perkins reminds us that “UV-induced damage and carcinogenesis is well documented, and you’re better off with any sunscreen than with none.” For sensitive populations like children and pregnant individuals, she prefers physical sunscreen when possible.</p></li><li class="accordion__item js-accordion-item is-active" readability=-1><p><span class=accordion__title>What is the difference between physical and chemical sunscreen?</span></p><p>These types of sunscreens differ in terms of ingredients, best uses, and various qualities. For instance, Dr. Perkins says that chemical sunscreens, which are absorbed into the skin where they then absorb the UV rays, convert them into heat, and later release them, are more sweat- and water-resistant and “may be a better option for outdoor sports or activities.” She says they also feel lighter on the skin and typically don’t leave behind a white residue. Physical sunscreens, on other hand, sit on top of the skin and reflect UV radiation and are often thicker and more prone to leaving a white cast.</p></li></ul><span class=heading-toc id=toc-why-trust-people></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--people commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Why Trust PEOPLE?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><br><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Madison Yauger</a> is a senior commerce writer for PEOPLE who’s tested hundreds of lifestyle products across all categories.
