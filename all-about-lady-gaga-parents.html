Cynthia and Joe enrolled their daughters in an all-girls Catholic School where they studied throughout their childhood before pursuing their respective careers.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Both Gaga's parents were very supportive of her musical pursuits, sensing her gifted talents at a very young age. However, that didn't stop them from being protective of their daughter.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"My dad <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>wouldn't give me money to go out on the weekends</a> because he knew I was going downtown and being bad," she told New York Magazine in 2011. However, Joe did encourage her musical passions — even offering to pay her <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>New York University rent for a year</a> if her music endeavors didn't work out.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Throughout Gaga's rise to stardom, her parents have been by her side. Gaga developed a stronger relationship with her mom since opening up about mental health and advocating for others to do the same. As for Joe, he's been <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>basking in a "proud dad" state of mind</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I used to wake up and think to myself, you know what? What happened? Where did this come from? I'm one of the luckiest guys in the world," he said on Mornings with Maria.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Here's everything to know about Gaga's parents, from their family restaurant to their non-profit organization.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-they-raised-lady-gaga-in-new-york-city></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>They raised Lady Gaga in New York City</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Kevin Mazur/Getty</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Joe and Cynthia raised Gaga in New York City's Upper West Side, where she grew up alongside her younger sister Natali — now, a fashion designer — in a Manhattan duplex. She and her sister were enrolled in Sacred Heart, an all-girls Catholic school near Guggenheim.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Those who attended the prestigious school came from diverse backgrounds. "Some had extreme wealth, others were on welfare and scholarship, and some were in the middle, which was my family," Gaga told New York Magazine at the start of her fame. <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>"All our money went into education and the house."</a></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">After school, Gaga waited tables at a diner, using one of her first paychecks to purchase a Gucci handbag like the designer goods the other girls had.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I was so excited because all the girls at Sacred Heart always had their fancy purses, and I always had whatever," she told the outlet.

At the time, Cynthia's mother-in-law, Angelina Germanotta, asked if they wanted Joe's childhood piano. Thinking it would be <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>"wonderful to have a piano in the house"</a> since they all loved music, Gaga's parents agreed to the offer.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-34 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"That family piano was the beginning of and a catalyst for a curious, creative, compassionate and self-driven baby girl," Cynthia said at Billboard's Women in Music 2015 as she presented the Woman of the Year award to her daughter.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-36 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"She learned to walk by grabbing on to the leg of that piano and pulling herself up and in the process, managed to reach the keys. She heard the sound and thereafter, day after day, she would go to the piano and press those black and white keys," Cynthia continued.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-38 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Four years later, she was playing by ear, and we asked if she wanted to take piano lessons at school. She didn't understand why because she said, 'Mommy, I hear music in my head,'" Cynthia explained. At age 6, Gaga wrote her first song — "Dollar Bills," a tune they later learned was inspired by Pink Floyd's "Money."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-they-own-a-family-restaurant-in-manhattan></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-40 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>They own a family restaurant in Manhattan</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-41 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Dimitrios Kambouris/Getty</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-42 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>In 2012</a>, Cynthia and Joe opened up <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nofollow>Joanne's Trattoria</a>, their family's Italian restaurant on the Upper West Side of Manhattan off Columbus Avenue. Despite its name, Gaga isn't as involved in the business as her parents.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-44 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The fare is Southern Italian, paying homage to the Germanotta's roots, combined with chef Art Smith's specialty cuisine as a Florida native. (Smith was formally the personal chef to <a href=# data-inlink=true data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Oprah Winfrey</a>, in addition to notable Florida politicians.)</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-46 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Since its inception, Joanne's Trattoria has thrived; however, recent economic factors — in part due to the COVID-19 pandemic — have made it <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>"harder to make ends meet,"</a> Joe told Fox News in February 2023.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-48 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Simultaneously, Joe owned Art Bird & Whiskey Bar in New York City's Grand Central Terminal. The restaurant opened in 2018 but permanently closed after Joe <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>"refused to pay rent"</a> on the establishment, reported Fox Business in 2020.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-cynthia-co-founded-the-born-this-way-foundation-with-lady-gaga></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-50 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Cynthia co-founded the Born This Way Foundation with Lady Gaga</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-51 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Dimitrios Kambouris/Getty Images for National Board of Review</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-52 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In 2012, Cynthia and Gaga co-founded the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Born This Way Foundation</a> (named after the singer's second album and title track released in 2011), a non-profit that places focus on empowering youth and emphasizing equality by addressing issues like self-confidence, well-being, anti-bullying, mentoring and career development.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-54 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"It's something that's <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>very, very personal to us</a> and it goes back to the struggles Stefani had growing up," Cynthia told PEOPLE of the organization. "She envisioned a world where young people were better equipped to deal with her struggles than she was."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-56 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In 2019, Cynthia was named by the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>United Nations' World Health Organization</a> as one of the four Goodwill Ambassadors, specifically for mental health.

"We've found a way to channel kindness into our lives in a way that's also healed our relationship."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-68 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The mother-daughter duo is proud of how far they've come since Gaga's younger years and have forged an unbreakable bond.

She helped me do that," Cynthia said of her daughter.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-70 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Gaga added: "I'm just really grateful that my mom holds space for me to be able to talk about how I feel.
