effective until 6pm tonight.</p><p><a href=#>The Met Office</a> predict the worst hit areas could be lashed with a month's rain in a day.</p><p>The forecaster said: "Following persistent and heavy rain over the past 24 hours, rain is expected to continue through Sunday morning before moving south and gradually easing later.</p><p>"This significant rainfall also has the potential to trigger shallow landslides and debris flows, most likely across the south of the Highland region and Argyll."</p><p>The amber alert covers areas of north western&nbsp;<a href=#>Scotland</a> including Ullapool and Fort William.</p><p>It is predicted 100 to 150 mm of rainfall will come down widely but west-facing upslopes could see around 200 mm - about 8 inches.</p><p>Meteorologists warned "fast flowing or deep floodwater is likely, causing danger to life".</p><p>The amber alert also brings a "slight chance of power cuts" and a "good chance some communities will be cut off by blocked roads".</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in The Sun</h2></p><p>Meanwhile, "persistent, heavy rain" will likely spark chaos on the roads, prompting closures and "difficult driving conditions".</p><p>"Homes and businesses could be flooded, causing damage to some buildings," the warning added.</p><p>The unsettled weather could also cause delays and cancellations to&nbsp;<a href=#>public transport</a>&nbsp;services so it is important to check your route before travelling.</p><p>Ferry operator CalMac announced on X/Twitter the cancellation of several of services.</p><p>Meanwhile, ScotRail has warned passengers to check for their journeys before setting off.</p><p>Wet and wild conditions have also seen speed restrictions put in place on a number of railway lines in the Highlands and west of Scotland.</p><p>At present a flood warning covers areas in Strath Oykel, while more alerts have been issued in Caithness and Sutherland, Argyll and Bute, Easter Ross and Great Glen, Skye and Lochaber, and Wester Ross.</p><p>A yellow weather warning is also in force for rain, which began at 6pm on Saturday and ends at midnight today.</p><p>It covers the same areas in north western <a href=#>Scotland</a>, but extends out to the Scottish Highlands, Portree, Tobermory and nearly reaches Stirling.</p><p>A fresh yellow weather warning for wind has also been issued today covering large parts of <a href=#>Newcastle </a>until 6pm.</p><p>Flooding wreaked havoc in <a href=#>Worcestershire </a>this morning, as the town of Kidderminster saw homes and business partially submerged.</p><p>A water main burst in the early hours of the morning and the town is now without water.</p><p>Commuters were spotted navigating flood water on the road, as rescue services attended flooded properties.</p><p>Met Office meteorologists explained how the jet stream to the north of the UK, and pressure to the south has created a mix of weather across Britain.</p><p>"This pressure pattern brings dry, settled weather for southern areas while&nbsp;low pressure systems&nbsp;track to the north of the UK," stated the Met Office.</p><p>"Here, a slow-moving weather front will bring a spell of persistent and at times heavy rain to northwest Scotland."</p><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">AMBER WEATHER WARNING FOR RAIN</h3></p><p class=article__content--intro>What to expect, according to the Met Office:</p><ul><li>There is a slight chance of power cuts and loss of other services to some homes and businesses</li><li>Spray and flooding probably leading to difficult driving conditions and some road closures</li><li>Fast flowing or deep floodwater is likely, causing danger to life</li><li>Delays and some cancellations to train and bus services are likely</li><li>Homes and businesses could be flooded, causing damage to some buildings</li><li>A good chance some communities will be cut off by blocked roads</li></ul><p>It comes after Brits were issued more than 30 flood alerts across the UK on Thursday.</p><p>Heavy rain sparked traffic chaos as drivers were forced to abandon their cars after becoming<a href=#>&nbsp;submerged under floodwater</a>.</p><p>Emergency services, including paramedics and crew from&nbsp;<a href=#>Essex&nbsp;</a>County Fire and Rescue Service, were called out to Buttsbury Wash to help a woman trapped in a flood.</p><p>And, multiple vehicles became stuck in <a href=#>Norfolk </a>yesterday along the A1101 in Welney, dubbed Britain's lowest road.</p><p>An Asda delivery van was spotted in the middle of floodwater which reached all the way to the trucks headlights.</p><p>Meanwhile, looking forward to Christmas, snow has also been predicted for some of the UK in the days&nbsp;<a href=#>leading up to the big day.</a></p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>Higher parts of northern areas are forecast to see the white stuff, however it is not expected to settle for long.</p><p>"Late in the week potential for a mild spell in the south as rain moves in with some small amounts of hill snow in the north before a period of more north or north-westerly winds with showers across coasts and turning wintry over hills," predicted the Met Office long range forecast.</p><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">STAYING SAFE</h3></p><p class=article__content--intro>Six simple steps to protect your home or business from flooding, according to the Met
