Diddy and Cassie’s relationship began after the “I’ll Be Missing You” rapper split from <strong>Kim Porter</strong>, with whom he shares four children: stepson Quincy, son Christian and twin daughters D’Lila and Jessie. (Diddy also shares son Justin with his high school sweetheart <strong>Misa Hylton-Brim</strong> and daughter Chance with ex <strong>Sarah Chapman</strong>.)</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Sean-Diddy-Combs-and-Ex-Girlfriend-Cassie-s-Relationship-Ups-and-Downs-A-Timeline-224.jpg><h3><strong>2012</strong></h3><p>Cassie and Diddy publicly confirmed their relationship by attending several events together, including <strong>Kanye West’</strong>s Paris Fashion Week runway show that March.</p><h3><strong>February 2014</strong></h3><p>“Baby do you like it? I just want to get you wat you Like! I just wanna Mk you smile 🙂 #takeDat!” Diddy captioned an Instagram photo of a diamond ring, sparking engagement speculation. Cassie was later seen wearing the rock, but neither party ever confirmed an engagement.</p><h3><strong>December 2015</strong></h3><p>Rumors that the pair called it quits surfaced after Cassie posted a photo of a sleeping baby meme on Instagram that read, “How I sleep … knowing that I’m single and nobody cheating on me.” She quickly deleted the post.</p><h3><strong>August 2016</strong></h3><p>Following a headline-making argument in Beverly Hills, the couple once again sparked breakup rumors. However, Us Weekly exclusively confirmed at the time that <a href=#>Cassie and Diddy were still together</a> and the altercation was just an argument.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Sean-Diddy-Combs-and-Ex-Girlfriend-Cassie-s-Relationship-Ups-and-Downs-A-Timeline-229.jpg><h3><strong>January 2018</strong></h3><p>“I love children. I’m trying to get 10,” Diddy revealed during an appearance on Power 105.1 FM’s The Breakfast Club. “Whatever is supposed to happen in the future is going to happen, but that’s something that I want. I would only have it with my girl [Cassie], of course.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Sean-Diddy-Combs-and-Ex-Girlfriend-Cassie-s-Relationship-Ups-and-Downs-A-Timeline-231.jpg><h3><strong>October 2018</strong></h3><p>Less than one year later, news broke that <a href=#>Cassie and Diddy had parted ways</a> for good. “They are indeed no longer together and haven’t been for months,” Cassie’s rep said in a statement to LoveBScott at the time. The split announcement came one month after Diddy was spotted with model <strong>Jocelyn Chew</strong> in Miami.</p><h3><strong>January 2019</strong></h3><p>Cassie moved on with personal trainer Fine, <a href=#>which a source told Us was a blow for Diddy</a>, who originally hired Fine to work with the singer. “Diddy’s ego wasn’t just shot,” the insider claimed to Us. “This is their realest breakup … They were in love for many years. They were in a very real relationship for over a decade. They broke up and always got back together.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Sean-Diddy-Combs-and-Ex-Girlfriend-Cassie-s-Relationship-Ups-and-Downs-A-Timeline-234.jpg><h3><strong>June 2019</strong></h3><p>After Cassie announced she was expecting her first baby with Fine, Diddy sent his well-wishes via social media. “Congratulations @Cassie and Alex,” Diddy captioned a photo of the pair via Instagram. “I wish you all nothing but love and happiness. God bless ❤️❤️❤️ L O V E.”</p><h3><strong>September 2019</strong></h3><p>Diddy shared a cryptic message via Instagram after news broke that <a href=#>Cassie and Fine tied the knot</a>. “Keep Going. I’ve got you. – The Universe,” the quote read. Three months later, Cassie welcomed her and Fine’s <a href=#>first daughter, Frankie</a>. The couple expanded their family in March 2021 with <a href=#>the arrival of daughter Sunny</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Sean-Diddy-Combs-and-Ex-Girlfriend-Cassie-s-Relationship-Ups-and-Downs-A-Timeline-235.jpg><h3><strong>November 2023</strong></h3><p>“After years in silence and darkness,” Cassie said in a statement to The New York Times after filing a bombshell lawsuit against Diddy for alleged abuse and assault. “I am finally ready to tell my story, and to speak up on behalf of myself and for the benefit of other women who face violence and abuse in their relationships.”</p><p>Diddy, meanwhile, issued a statement of denial via his legal team that same day. “Mr. Combs vehemently denies these offensive and outrageous allegations. For the past six months, Mr. Combs has been subjected to Ms. Ventura’s persistent demand of $30 million, under the threat of writing a damaging book about their relationship, which was unequivocally rejected as blatant blackmail,” his lawyer <strong>Ben Brafman</strong> said in a statement to the outlet. “Despite withdrawing her initial threat, Ms. Ventura has now resorted to filing a lawsuit riddled with baseless and outrageous lies, aiming to tarnish Mr. Combs’s reputation and seeking a payday.”</p><p>Cassie’s legal team, for its part, claimed that Diddy offered her “eight figures to silence her,” which she rejected. Instead, she sued her ex-boyfriend for allegedly harming her in the past both physically and sexually.</p><p>She alleged in the lawsuit that when she dated rapper <strong>Kid Cudi</strong> in 2012, Diddy got so angry he threatened to blow up the musician’s car. “Around that time, Kid Cudi’s car exploded in his driveway,” the documents state. Cudi told the NY Times that Cassie’s account of the story was “all true.”</p><p>One day after filing the lawsuit, Cassie confirmed to <i>Us&nbsp;</i>that<i>&nbsp;</i>she and Diddy had reached a settlement.</p><p class=x_elementToProof>“I have decided to resolve this matter amicably on terms that I have some level of control over,” the singer said in a November 17 statement distributed by her attorney <strong>Doug Wigdor</strong>. “I want to thank my family, fans and lawyers for their unwavering support.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=x_elementToProof>Diddy also released a statement through Wigdor, sharing that they had decided to resolve the matter “amicably.”</p><p>If you or someone you know has been sexually assaulted, contact <a href=# rel=noopener>the National Sexual Assault Hotline</a> at 1-800-656-HOPE (4673).</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGasnZGjeqW1w52wZpufoq%2B0ecCnm2adqGK0qr7Ln6minZ6ZeqSt0qygnqtdp7KtrdOipqermJ69bsDIppyloZ6afA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fsean-diddy-combs-and-ex-girlfriend-cassies-relationship-timeline.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fsean-diddy-combs-and-ex-girlfriend-cassies-relationship-timeline.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fsean-diddy-combs-and-ex-girlfriend-cassies-relationship-timeline.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fsean-diddy-combs-and-ex-girlfriend-cassies-relationship-timeline.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fsean-diddy-combs-and-ex-girlfriend-cassies-relationship-timeline.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fsean-diddy-combs-and-ex-girlfriend-cassies-relationship-timeline.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./betty-lynn-net-worth-death-andy-griffith-today.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./betty-lynn-net-worth-death-andy-griffith-today.html>What was Betty Lynn of the Andy Griffith show's net worth?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./nick-carter-and-lauren-kitt-welcome-rainbow-baby-girl.html>Nick Carter and Lauren Kitt Welcome Rainbow Baby Girl!!!</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./nick-carter-and-lauren-kitt-welcome-rainbow-baby-girl.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
